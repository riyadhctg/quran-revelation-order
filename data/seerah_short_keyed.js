       "Combined_Content": "# The descendants of Ibrahim (AS) - 2000 BCE:        \n\nThe Prophet Ibrahim (AS), also known as the friend of Allah, is considered to have been the great grandfather of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ , who followed his great grandfather's zeal in believing in, and calling to, the purest form of monotheism. His date of birth is unknown though many opinions exist with considerable variations.\nHis son, Isma'il and his wife Haajar, after being provided with a heavenly sustenance, settled in the valleys around Makkah along with a Yemeni tribe, Jurhum. It was in Makkah that father and son built the Ka'bah, raising its pillars in compliance with Allah's decree and then calling the people to make pilgrimage to it. Isma'il himself had twelve sons from the daughter of Mudad (chief of the tribe of Jurhum), whose names were Nabet, Qidar, Edbael, Mebsham, Mishma', Duma, Micha, Hudud, Yetma, Yetour, Nafis and Qidman, and who ultimately formed twelve tribes inhabiting Makkah and trading between Yemen, Shaam, and Egypt.\nLater on, these tribes spread all over the peninsula, sometimes even outside of its boundaries. Of the twelve tribes, all died out except the descendants of two: Nabet and Qidar.\nThe Nabeteans (or sons of Nabet) established a flourishing civilisation in the north of Hijaz, making Petra (in current day Jordan) their capital until the Romans came and defeated their kingdom. The descendants of Qidar, lived long in Makkah increasing in number, specifically by way of 'Adnan and his son Ma'ad to whom 'Adnanian Arabs traced back their ancestry. 'Adnan was the twenty-first grandfather in the series of the Prophetic ancestry. Nizar, Ma'ad's only son, had four sons who branched out into four great tribes; Eyad, Anmar, Rabi'a and Mudar. The Mudar tribes branched out into two great divisions: Qais 'Ailan bin Mudar and the branch of Elias bin Mudar. Of Elias bin Mudar were Tamim bin Murra, Hudhail bin Mudrika, Banu Asad bin Khuzaimah and the division of Kinana bin Khuzaimah, of whom came Quraysh, the descendants of Fahr bin Malik bin An-Nadr bin Kinana.\nQuraysh branched out into various tribes, the most famous of whom were Jumah, Sahm, 'Adi, Makhzum, Tayim, Zahra and the three branches of Qusai ibn Kilab: 'Abd Al Dar bin Qusai, Asad bin 'Abdul 'Uzza bin Qusai and 'Abd Manaf bin Qusai.\n'Abd Manaf branched out into four tribes: 'Abd Shams, Nawfal, Muttalib and Hashim. It is, however, from the family of Hashim that Allah selected the final Prophet and Messenger, Muhammad ﷺ the son of 'Abdullah the son of 'Abdul Muttalib the son of Hashim, may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him.\n\n\n\n\n# The ascendancy of Quraysh - 400 CE:        \nThe Quraysh had settled in Makkah towards the end of the fifth century. Their ancestor Qusayy (the fifth grandfather of the Prophet), his brother Zuhrah and his uncle Taym had settled in the Makkan valley besides the Sanctuary (Haram). Makhzum, the son of another uncle, and his cousins Jumah and Sahm settled there with Qusayy and they and the clans named after them became known as the Quraysh of the Hollow.\nQusayy’s more remote kinsman settled in the surrounding countryside and were known as the Quraysh of the Outskirts. Legend has it that Qusayy had travelled to Syria and brought the three goddesses al-Lat, al-Uzza and Manat to the Hijaz and enthroned the Nabetean god Hubal in the Ka’bah, the Holy House.\nIn a campaign that combined trickery and force the Quraysh managed to take control of the Makkah and expel the Khuza’ah, its guardian tribe who were considered to have failed their sacred trust of maintaining the Ka’bah.\nOf Qusayy’s descendants, 'Abd al Dar was the eldest although his brother 'Abd Manaf was more famous and respected. As Qusayy grew old he delegated the positions of authority to 'Abd al Dar and handed over to him the keys of the Holy House. ‘Abd al Dar discharged the new duties incumbent upon him as his father had directed. His sons did likewise after him but could not match the sons of 'Abd Manaf in honour and popular esteem. Hence, Hashim, 'Abd Shams, al Muttalib and Nawfal, the sons of 'Abd Manaf, resolved to take over these privileges from their cousins. The two factions set the stage for a civil war, but an agreement was reached in the form of a power sharing deal. Thereafter the two parties lived in peace until the advent of Islam.\nHashim \n Hashim was the leader of his people, a prosperous man who was given the honourable position of feeding and providing drink to the pilgrims of Makkah as an outcome to compromise between the sons of 'Abd Manaf and Abd al Dar. However, his role as leader was encapsulated by his generosity were once, during a drought, he provided food for the whole population of Makkah. He made an unprecedented move by regulating and standardising the two annual caravan trips to Yemen and Shaam. It was under his wise leadership that Makkah prospered and became the acknowledged capital of Arabia. From this position of influence the descendants of 'Abd Manaf concluded peace treaties with their neighbours, the Ghassanids, Byzantinium, Abyssinians, Persians, and the Himyarite of Yemen.\nHashim quickly rose to power and remained the chief of Makkah; and even though his nephew, Umayyah ibn 'Abd Shams, attempted to challenge his rule, nothing was lost and Umayyah was exiled to Shaam for ten years. Of the most important of his trips was his journey to Shaam where he stopped in Yathrib. Upon arrival he saw a woman of noble birth engaging in business with some of her agents -  Salma, the daughter of 'Amr of the Khazraj tribe. Hashim sought her hand in marriage and upon her acceptance, she moved to Makkah to live with him for a while before she returned to Yathrib where she gave birth to a son called Shaybah, whom she kept with her.\nAbd al Muttalib\n Several years later Hashim died on one of his trips and was buried in Gaza. His brother, al Muttalib, succeeded him in his posts. One day al Muttalib thought of his nephew Shaybah. Thus, he went to Yathrib and asked Salma to hand the child over now that he had become fully grown, for he would restore his father’s authority back at the Holy Precinct. On return to Makkah, al Muttalib entered the city with the young boy riding behind him on his camel. The Quraysh, assuming that Shaybah was a servant of al Muttalib, called him Abd al Muttalib, the slave of al Muttalib.\nWhen al Muttalib sought to return to his nephew the wealth which Hashim left behind, his uncle Nawfal objected and seized the wealth. Abd al Muttalib waited until he grew older even after the death of al Muttalib and then asked for the support of his maternal uncles in Yathrib against his uncles in Makkah. Eighty Khazraj horsemen arrived from Yathrib ready to give him the military support he needed in order to reclaim his rights. Nawfal refused to fight and returned the seized wealth. Abd al Muttalib was then assigned the offices which Hashim occupied. Given that the well of Zamzam had been destroyed, water had to be brought in from a number of subsidiary wells situated at the outskirts of Makkah and placed in smaller reservoirs near the Ka'bah. Since the plurality of sons considerably aided the execution of such a task, Abd al Muttalib faced a great deal of hardship as he had only one son.\nOne night, while sleeping there, he had a dream in which he was commanded to 'dig sweetness.' 'What is sweetness?' he asked but received no answer. The next night, in another dream he was commanded to 'dig goodness.' He asked, 'What is goodness?' and again received no answer. The third night he was commanded to 'dig the buried treasure,' and when asking after it, received silence as his response. The next night, he was commanded to 'dig Zamzam,' and his asking after it elicited the response, 'It will never dry up, never run low, and it will water the throngs of pilgrims.' He was given signs that would direct him to its place and the next morning, his investigations led him to a place between the hills of Safaa and Marwah and with his only son, he began to dig. On each of the two hills was an idol to which the pagans would offer sacrifices. Digging in this place between their gods offended the Quraysh and they asked 'Abdu'l- Muttalib to stop, arguing that what he was doing was sacrilegious. When he refused, they threatened him. He still refused, arguing that he was following what he had seen in a vision and set his son to guard him. The situation became tense, tempers were frayed, and realising the precariousness of the situation, coupled with the fact that no doubt, in their view, a vision of a respected leader was significant, the Quraysh backed down and allowed him to dig. Some accounts relate that he dug for three days and finally struck the stone covering the well. Next to it, he discovered two gold gazelles and some swords, shields and breast-plates. Recognising them as the items left behind by the tribe of Jurhum, he magnified God and cried out, 'Here is the well of Isma'il!'\nThe Quraysh rushed to him and asked him to give them a share of the well arguing that they were all descendants of Isma’il. He refused, but suggested they go for arbitration. In pre-Islamic time the soothsayer and fortune teller was held in esteem and awe, and it was a measure of the respect accorded them that in cases of disputes, it was the habit of Arabs to go to them for arbitration. This is what 'Abd al Muttalib and  Quraysh decided to do. Choosing the soothsayer of Banù Sa'd Hudhaym in the uplands of Syria, they set off. On the way there, they ran out of water and having given up all hope, dug their own graves and waited for death. Then water was discovered under the place that Abd al Muttalib's mount was and seeing this as an omen, they decided the rights to Zamzam belonged entirely to Abd al Muttalib and returned to Makkah instead of continuing their journey.\nOverwhelmed Abd al Muttalib made a solemn vow to sacrifice one of his children to the Ka'bah if he was granted ten sons. His wish was fulfilled, and he called them to assist him in the fulfilment of his vow. It was agreed that the name of each one of them would be written on a divinatory arrow, that the arrows would be drawn near Hubal within the Ka'bah and that he whose name appeared on the drawn arrow would be sacrificed. When the arrows were drawn it was the arrow of Abdullah, the youngest son of 'Abd al Muttalib and the most beloved. Quraysh, Abdullah's uncles from the Makhzum tribe and his brother Abu Talib all insisted that Abdullah be spared and that some kind of indulgence be sought from the god Hubal. In the end, they ransomed his life for one hundred camels which were sacrificed right away.\nLater on, 'Abdul Muttalib chose Amina, daughter of Wahab, as a wife for his son, 'Abdullah. In light of her ancestral lineage, she stood eminent in respect of nobility of position and descent. Her father was the chief of Bani Zahra to whom great honour was attributed. They were married in Makkah, and soon after, 'Abdullah went on a trade journey and died on his way back.\n'Abdullah left very little wealth —five camels, a small number of goats, a she-servant called Barakah, famously known as Umm Aiman who would later serve as the Prophet's nursemaid.\nEnd of 400 CE\n\n\n\n# Political and Religious Status of Arabia - 550 CE:\nWhen Muhammad ﷺ was born in the city of Makkah in about 570, neither of the great powers of the region gave Arabia a second thought. Persia and Byzantium were both locked in a debilitating struggle with one another, which ended shortly before Muhammad ﷺ passed away. Though the southern lands of Arabia benefitted from monsoon rains and a sophisticated culture, the intractable steppes of Arabia were a terrifying wilderness, inhabited by a wild race of men to whom the Greeks had given the name 'Sarakenoi', the people who dwell in tents. Neither Persia nor Byzantium considered invading this desolate region and nobody would have dreamed that it was about to give birth to a new world religion, which would soon become a major global power.\nThe Christian Empire of Byzantium had made Abyssinia, the modern Ethiopia, a client state when it had converted to an heretical form of Christianity know as  Monophysitism, and rejected the Chalcedonian resolution. Byzantium encouraged the ruler, the Negus, to infiltrate Yemen and bring it under the sovereignty of Constantinople.  But instead of standing up to the enemy, the Southern Arabians sought help from the Persians against the Abyssinian threat; and they were only too happy to oblige. The Zoroastrian Persians Empire favoured Judaism to Christianity and in 510 Yusuf As'ai, the King of South Arabia, converted to Judaism and became known as Dhu Nuwas, He of the Hanging Locks. But this bid for Persian patronage failed when the Jewish kingdom fell to the Abyssinia in 525. It's people would constantly appeal to Persia when eventually in 570 King Khusrua did invade the region and so it became their colony.\nThe settled Arabs, who lived in the towns and agricultural communities of the Hijaz, had developed a different kind of religious vision. They were more interested in the gods that the Bedouins believed in. Very few mythical stories were told about the various deities. Their pagan beliefs acknowledged God as the most important God, and He was revered as the Lord of the Kabah, but He was a remote figure and had very little influence on the people's daily lives. Everybody knew that Allah had created the world; that he quickened each human embryo in the womb; and that he was the giver of rain. But these remained abstract beliefs. Arabs would sometimes pray to Allah in an emergency, but once the danger had passed they forgot all about Him.\nQuraysh also worshipped other gods such as Hubal, al-Lat, al-Uzza and al-Manat- who were referred to as the daughters of God. Although they were lesser in rank than God, they were often called his \"\"companions\"\" or \"\"partners\"\". They loved these goddesses and begged them to intercede on their behalf to God.\nThis idol worship was a relatively new religious enthusiasm, which had been imported from Syria by one of the Makkan elders called ‘Amr ibn Luhai who believed that they could bring rain, but had no idea why- the Syrians had named it Hubal. The gods of Arabia gave their worshippers no moral guidance; even though many found the rituals spiritually satisfying, some of Quraysh held idol worship as abominable and sought a purer form of monotheism known as hanafiyyah- uncorrupted pure religion which Ibrahim (AS) was upon. This was no organised sect but merely a group of individuals who despised the worship of anyone other than God- Abd al Muttalib, the grandfather of the Prophet, was one such person.\nAmongst the Arabs lived Christians and Jews; those who came in contact with them felt an acute sense of inferiority: it seemed that God had left the Arabs out of His divine plan. But this was all to be changed.\nEnd of 550 CE\n\n\n\n\n# The Kabah is attacked - 569 CE: \nThe respect and esteem which Makkah and the Holy house enjoyed suggested to some distant provinces in Arabia that they should construct Holy houses in order to attract some of the people away from Makkah. The Ghassanids built such a house at al Hirah and Abrahah al Ashram built another in Yemen.\nAbraha was the Abyssinian (Ethiopian) viceroy in Yemen who built a magnificent cathedral in San'a, hoping thereby to make it supersede Makkah as the great place of pilgrimage for all Arabia. A man from the Kinana, akin to the Quraysh tribe, understood what Abraha was trying to achieve, and so, he entered the complex stealthily at night and smeared its front wall with excrement. When knowledge of the Arab's insolent act reached Abraha, he led an army of sixty thousand warriors with a vow to raze the Ka'bah to the ground. His army included a number of elephants which he planned to use to trample his opponents.\nQuraysh and other neighbouring tribes held a council of war, and decided that it was useless to try to resist the enemy. Under the advice of Abdul Muttalib, Quraysh withdrew to the mountain sides, informing the people that the Ka'bah had a Lord who would protect it.\nWhen Abraha reached the Muhassar valley, between Muzdalifah and Mina, the elephant that he was riding knelt down and refused to proceed. They did everything they could to bring him to his feet; they even beat him about the head with iron rods, but he remained like a rock. It was then that Allah dealt with the elephant army under the command of Abrahah and ruined their plan. The western sky grew black, and a strange sound was heard; its volume increased as a great wave of darkness swept upon them from the direction of the sea, and above their heads, as high as they could see, was full of birds. He sent against them birds, in flocks, striking them with stones of Sijjeel with such velocity that they pierced even coats of mail. Every stone hit its mark and killed its man, for as soon as a body was struck its flesh began to rot.\n When the enemy had been thus routed, the Qurayshites returned home safely.\nThe Event of the Elephant took place in the month of Muharram, fifty or fifty five days before the birth of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ which corresponded to late February or early March 570 A.D.\n\n\n\n\n\n# The birth of Prophet (PBUH) - 570 CE: \nMuhammad ﷺ was born into the clan of Hashim, one of the most distinguished family groups in Makkah. His great-grandfather had been the first merchant to engage in the independent trade with Syria and Yemen and the clan had the privilege of providing the pilgrims with water during the hajj, one of the most important offices in the city. Muhammad ﷺ’s father, ‘Abdullah, died before he was born and his mother Aminah was in such straitened circumstances that, it was said, the only bedouin woman who was willing to be his wet nurse came from one of the poorest tribes in Arabia.\nPrior to his birth Aminah was conscious of a light within her, and one day it shone forth from her so intensely that she could see the castles of Bosra in Syria, later recipients to the light of Islam. Upon his birth the Prophet’s mother immediately sent someone to inform his grandfather ‘Abd al Muttalib of the good news. Happily he came, and carrying the new-born to the Ka‘bah, the old man prayed to Allah and thanked Him. ‘Abd al Muttalib named the baby Muhammad- the praised one, a name, although known, not then common amongst the Arabs. The baby was circumcised on the seventh day and a feast was held as was the custom of the Arabs. The people were surprised at the choice of name and enquired as to the reason why Abd al Muttalib had not chosen a name of his kinsfolk as was common practice. He replied, 'because I wanted Allah to praise him in heaven and His creatures to praise him on earth.’\nEnd of 570 CE\n\n\n\n\n\n# Early Childhood - 571 CE: \nIt was the general custom of the Arabs to send their children away to bedouin wet nurses so that they might grow up with fresh air for the breasts, pure Arabic for the tongue, and freedom for the soul. Away from the hustle and bustle of the town they were to form a lasting bond with the desert and would spend up to eight years there.\nThe bedouin tribes would visit the Quraysh periodically and in the year Muhammad ﷺ was born many tribes had suffered from severe famine. The tribe of Bani Sa’d were desperate and despite Muhammad ﷺ being an orphan child of poor background, Halima, decided to take him anyway because she had not been able to find another suckling. But Halima was so hungry herself that she had no milk to give her own baby, the milk of her camel had dried up and even the donkey on which she had ridden to Makkah was on its last legs. But this is what happened as soon as she took the baby Muhammad ﷺ:\n“When I lifted him in my arms and returned to my place I put him on my breast and to my great surprise, my breasts overflowed with milk. He drank to his heart’s content and so too did his foster brother, and then both of them went to sleep although my baby had not been able to sleep the previous night. My husband then went to the she-camel to milk it and, to his astonishment, he found plenty of milk in it. He milked it and we drank to our fill, and enjoyed a sound sleep during the night. The next morning, my husband said: \"\"By Allah Halimah, you must understand that you have been able to procure a blessed child.\"\" And I replied: \"\"By the grace of Allah, I hope so.\"\"”\nNot surprisingly Halima was reluctant to lose Muhammad ﷺ and begged Aminah to let him stay with them a little longer. Then a frightening but portentous incident made her change her mind.\nThe story goes that one day Muhammad ﷺ’s foster brothers had rushed to their ?parents, crying in terror that two men in white had seized Muhammad ﷺ and had seemed to slit his chest open. Halima had rushed to the scene to find the little boy lying weakly on the ground: later he explained the men had taken his heart from his body and extracted a blood-clot out of it and said: \"\"That was the part of Satan in thee.\"\" They then washed it with the water of Zamzam in a gold basin. After that the heart was joined together and restored to its place.\nAfter this event, Halimah was worried about the boy and returned him to his mother who calmed them down and reassured them of Muhammad ﷺ’s exceptional nature. She decided to keep him with her in Makkah, but when he was six years old Aminah died and Muhammad ﷺ had been orphaned twice over. He went to live in the household of his grandfather Abdul Muttalib who grew to love him dearly. Nonetheless, his orphanhood cut deeply into Muhammad ﷺ’s soul. Even the Quran had to console the Prophet reminding him, as it were, \"\"Did Allah not find you an orphan and give you shelter and protection? Did He not find you erring and guide you to the truth?\"\" It is related that a mattress was put in the shade of the Ka‘bah for ‘Abdul-Muttalib. His children used to sit around the mattress in honour to their father, but Muhammad ﷺ used to sit on it. His uncles would take him back, but if ‘Abdul-Muttalib was present, he would say: \"\"Leave my grandson alone. I swear by Allah that this boy will hold a significant position.\"\" He used to seat the boy on his mattress, pat his back and was always pleased with what the boy did.\nEnd of 571 CE\n\n\n\n\n\n# Death of Abdul Muttalib - 578 CE: It would have been somewhat easier on the orphaned boy had Abd al Muttalib lived longer than he did, but with the decree of Allah, the Prophet’s grandfather passed away at the age of eighty whilst the Prophet was eight years old.\nThe charge of Muhammad ﷺ now fell to Abu Talib, his uncle. Abu Talib was not the eldest of the brothers but notably the most appropriate and took the charge of his nephew in the best way, singling out the boy with great respect and high esteem. Abu Talib remained for forty years cherishing his nephew and extending all possible protection and support to him; at times to his own detriment.\nWhen the Prophet  was twelve years old, he went with his uncle Abu Talib on a business journey to Syria. When they reached Busra they met a monk called Bahira who recognised the Prophet and said while taking his hand: \"\"This is the master of all humans. Allah will send him with a Message which will be a mercy to all beings.\"\" Abu Talib asked: \"\"How do you know that?\"\" He replied: \"\"When you appeared from the direction of ‘Aqabah, all stones and trees prostrated themselves, which they never do except for a Prophet. I can recognize him also by the seal of Prophethood which is below his shoulder, like an apple. We have got to learn this from our books.\"\" He also asked Abu Talib to send the boy back to Makkah and not to take him to Syria for fear of the Jews. Abu Talib obeyed and sent him back to Makkah with some of his servants.\nEnd of 578 CE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# League of the Virtuous - 585 CE: \nDuring Muhammad ﷺ’s childhood a telling incident revived the old conflict between the Ahlaf (the Confederates) and the Mutayyabun (the Scented Ones) and showed how dramatically the fortunes of Hashim had plummeted when Abdul Muttalib was an old man.\nAfter the conclusion of the Fijar wars, a Yemeni merchant had sold some goods to one of the most important men in the clan of Sahm, from the Confederates. But he refused to pay for them and the Yemeni appealed to the tribe of Quraysh as a whole to see that justice was done. The chief of the clam of Taym, one of the Scented Ones, called a meeting to which he invited anybody who cared about justice and right dealing.  Representatives from the clan of Hashim, Al-Muttalib, Asad and Zahrah- who were all from the Scented Ones- responded and made a pact which was later known as the Hilf al-Fudul, the League of the Virtuous.\nIt is said that the spirit of this pact and the course of deliberations therein marked a complete departure from the pre-Islamic tribal-pride. The boy Muhammad ﷺ was said to have been present at the ceremony and to have spoken highly of this chivalric association. Shortly after having been honoured with Prophethood, he stated: \"\"I witnessed a confederacy in the house of ‘Abdullah bin Jad‘an. It was more appealing to me than herds of cattle. Even now in the period of Islam I would respond positively to attending such a meeting if I were invited.”\nEnd of 585 CE\n\n\n\n\n\n# Marriage to Khadijah (RA) - 595 CE: \nMuhammad ﷺ, as had been the way of the Prophets before him, worked as a shepherd for Bani Sa‘d in Makkah. He would tend his flock on the mountainside, at times gone for the duration of the day. At the age of twenty-five, he was employed by Khadijah (RA), daughter of Khuwailid, a merchant and successful businessman whose vast wealth and business talents were inherited by his daughter, who despite being a women in a patriarchal society, successfully managed her father's business interests and preserved the family's fortune.\nKhadijah (RA) was known as the ‘Princess of Quraysh’ and ‘The Pure One’. Known to have had an impeccable character, she would feed and clothe the poor, assist her relatives with financial help, and provide for the marriage of those of her kin who could not otherwise have had the means to marry. It is reported that she neither believed in nor worshipped idols. Furthermore, in being notorious for her business acumen, many highly respected members of Quraysh sought her hand in marriage. However, she would always decline remaining unmarried.\nNever did Khadijah (RA) travel with her trade caravans, but instead she relied on others who acted on her behalf and would be compensated for their efforts. In 595 CE, Khadijah (RA) needed a representative for a transaction in Syria. Having had a good working relationship with Abu Talib, she was recommended to approach Muhammad ﷺ, especially given that he was known as Al-Sadiq (the truthful) and Al-Amin (the trustworthy).\nAlthough Muhammad ﷺ himself did not have any experience in the field, he had accompanied Abu Talib twice on trade trips and had keenly observed how Talib traded, bartered, bought, sold, and conducted business. Thus he was approached by Khuzaimah ibn Hakim who acted on behalf of Khadijah (RA) offering Muhammad ﷺ double the commission she usually paid. Maisarah, Khadijah (RA)’s servant, also went along, and during the journey he came to know the many impeccable qualities of the soon-to-be Prophet.\nOn arriving at Makkah, Muhammad ﷺ sent the money made to Khadijah (RA) who noticed that she had gained more profit than usual. She was also informed of Muhammad ﷺ’s good manners, honesty, deep thought, sincerity and faith. Upon reflection, Khadijah (RA) resolved that this was the man she intended to marry confiding in her friend Nufesah.\nWhen the prospect of marrying Khadijah (RA), now forty or perhaps slightly younger, was put to Muhammad ﷺ by Nufesah, he expressed his interest straight away. Nufesah informed Khadijah (RA) who then sent him a message asking the Prophet to come and see her. She stated that she admired him because of his good position amongst his people, as well as his honesty and good manners, and because he was a man of his word. She then made her proposal that they should get married.\nMuhammad ﷺ, gleaming with delight, thereafter went with his uncles to meet Khadijah (RA)’s uncle, Amr ibn 'Asad. Hamzah, the uncle of the Prophet spoke on behalf of his nephew and offered in dowry twenty camels. Naturally, Amr ibn 'Asad was unhesitant in his acceptance and thus the marriage then concluded at a dowry of twenty young camels with its contract witnessed by Bani Hashim and the heads of Mudar.\nA grand wedding then followed, with a number of sheep and camels slaughtered to feed the guests. One of whom came from a distant place in the desert- that was Halimah, the Prophet’s wet nurse who breast-fed him and took care of him for the first four years of his life. She came especially to attend his wedding. When she was about to leave, Khadijah (RA) gave her a generous gift, forty sheep to take home.\nKhadijah (RA) bore all of his children, except Ibrahim. Those associated to Khadijah (RA) were: Al-Qasim, Zainab (RA), Ruqaiyah (RA), Umm Kulthum (RA), Fatimah (RA) and ‘Abdullah.\nKhadijah (RA) was the Prophet’s ﷺ most beloved wife; he never married whilst married to her, and spoke of her with great affection and reverence later on. Indeed, she was a pillar of support for the Prophet ﷺ, especially throughout his most trialling days. And when she passed away, the Prophet ﷺ felt an emptiness no woman was ever able to fill.\nEnd of 595 CE",

       "Combined_Content": "# The first revelations - 610 CE (13 BH):\nThe Prophet ﷺ would, on many occasions, retreat to a state of seclusion in the mountains around the Ka'bah which would often serve as a source of comfort from the disturbing things he would witness living amongst his pagan neighbours. Here he would contemplate on the metaphysical and worship Allah in imitation of his forefather Ibrahim (AS), hoping that the Makkans would see the faults of their ways.\nThe commencement of Divine inspiration began six months before his fortieth birthday. It began in the form of dreams and visions which would come true the following day, and this lasted a total of six months. It was even before this that the Prophet began to long for seclusion. He would retreat to a nearby cave named Hira for periods of time taking with him light provisions.\nThen one day whilst in a state of meditation, he realised that he wasn't alone. Looking up, he saw a bright light; an angel had come to him ordering him to read. The Prophet replied alarmed, \"\"I do not know how to read.\"\"\nAlready startled by the presence of the angel, he attempted to make sense of the situation but before his thoughts could gather, the angel took hold of him powerfully, gripping him tightly, with unbearable force. The Prophet, reaching the point where he felt his body could endure no more, was released and ordered to read again, but replied, \"\"I do not know how to read.\"\"\nThereupon the angel clutched at his warping body and then released him and again asked him to read. But the Prophet had nothing to say except the truth, \"\"I do not know how to read.\"\"\nOn the third and final ordeal the angel released the Prophet saying, \n \"\"Recite in the name of your Lord who created, created man from a blood clot. Recite; and your Lord is the Most Generous. He who taught by the pen, taught man what he did not know\"\"\nThis new Messenger of Allah, being startled by the incident, stumbled out of the cave with his heart thumping causing his chest to shake and his eyes unable to focus. Fear had gripped him and he began to wonder whether this had been some sort of hallucination but everywhere he looked on the horizon, the angel would appear before him.\nFeeling as though he was one smitten with madness, he returned home stumbling down the mountain with sweat pouring down his head. His legs shook uncontrollably and his body quivered out of fright. Upon reaching his house, his wife Khadijah (RA) received him as he staggered into his abode saying, \"\"Cover me! Cover me!\"\" \n She wrapped him up until the state of terror had left him and then he described to Khadijah (RA) everything that had happened saying, \"\"I fear for myself.\"\" \n Khadijah (RA) replied words undeniably comforting to his heart, 'No, by Allah, Allah would never bring disgrace upon you. You maintain ties of kinship, bear people's burdens, help the destitute, give hospitality to your guests and help those who have been afflicted by calamities.'\nSeeing the despair of her husband, Khadijah (RA) was quite understandably taken aback. So in seeking counsel, she went with Muhammad ﷺ to Waraqah ibn Nawfal, her blind and old cousin who was a devout Christian. Khadijah (RA) said to Waraqah, \"\"Cousin! Listen to your nephew\"\" at which point he said, \"\"Nephew, what have you seen?\"\" The Prophet described to him everything he had seen. Waraqah then said to him, \"\"This is the Namus [Jibrail (AS)] which Allah sent to Moses. I wish that I were still young. I wish I might still be alive when your people drive you out!\"\"\nThe Messenger of Allah ﷺ asked, \"\"Will they drive me out?\"\" He said, \"\"Yes, no man has brought anything similar to what you have brought without being treated with hostility. If I am still alive on that day, I will give you my strong support.\"\"\nHowever, shortly thereafter Waraqah passed away. The reassurances from Khadijah (RA) and Waraqah were followed by a reassurance from Heaven in the form of a second revelation after which there was a period of silence. During that period, the Prophet  began to fear that he had incurred the displeasure of Allah because the revelation had stopped. Then at last the silence was broken, and there came further reassurance.\n\n\n\n\n# Private Propagations - 611 CE (12 BH):\nWith Makkah being the hub of the Arabs, it was also the capital of idols and stone graven images. The Prophet ﷺ knew very well the difficulty of the mission that lay ahead of him. Working in such an atmosphere, the call to Islam assumed a cloak of secrecy to ensure a gradual system of conversion in a manner that would make it difficult for Quraysh, the Makkan tribe, to interfere.\nThe Prophet ﷺ logically begun his Divine task at home and then moved on to close associates. It was these people who responded to the divine call and readily embraced this new faith. From amongst those who converted during the beginnings of the Divine call were Khadijah (RA), the Prophet's ﷺ wife, his adopted son Zaid bin Harithah (RA), his cousin 'Ali bin Abi Talib (RA), and his cherished friend Abu Bakr (RA). These were the individuals who professed Islam on the very first day of the call.\nThereafter, Abu Bakr (RA), through his own personal efforts, invited ‘Uthman bin Affan (RA), Al Zubair bin 'Awwam (RA), 'Abdur Rahman bin 'Awf (RA), Sa'd bin Abi Waqqas (RA), and Talhah bin Ubaidullah (RA). Among the early Muslims also were Bilal bin Rabah (RA), Abu Ubaidah bin Al-Jarrah (RA), Al-Arqam bin Abi Al-Arqam (RA), Fatimah bint Al-Khattab (RA) (the sister of 'Umar bin Al-Khattab), Khabbab bin Al-Aratt (RA), Abdullah bin Masud (RA) and many others.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n# Worship One God - 612 CE (11 BH):\nThe Prophet ﷺ used to meet and teach the new converts in privacy because the call to Islam was still based upon concealment. He would tell his followers not to divulge his secret without permission. Now the revelation began to increase in speed and continued to come down to the Prophet sometimes like the reverberations of a bell, which was the hardest on him. Other times Jibreel (AS) would come to him in the form of a man and speak to him.\nThe impulse which had prompted him to cry out \"\"cover me, cover me\"\" still came to him at times. The constant revealing of verses enabled the Prophet and his Companions to memorise and act out the message in ease. The verses revolved around subservience to Allah, the life of the Hereafter and Prophethood. The effect of this was that the early converts would have constant revelation concerning their predicament, a phenomenon that established for them that Allah was truly with them, close, and ever aware of what was happening. They were taught to greet one another with the words given to the Prophet by Jibreel (AS) as the greeting of the people of paradise, \"\"Peace be on you!\"\", to which one would answer \"\"And on you be peace\"\".\nThis year was a year of cultivation in that Allah was preparing the Prophet and his followers for what they would face once the call would be made openly. It was this cultivation that made the converts sincere, ever ready to face trials and willing to accept death rather than turn to polytheism. Indeed, this cultivation stood many a trial and many early converts were killed due to their unshakable stance and resolute faith.",
       "Stage_summary": "\nDuring this period of Prophet Muhammad's (pbuh) life, he sought solace in the mountains around the Ka'bah, reflecting on the metaphysical and emulating his forefather Ibrahim (AS). Divine inspiration commenced six months before his fortieth birthday, starting with dreams and visions. In a pivotal moment in the cave of Hira, the angel Jibreel (AS) commanded him to read, initiating his prophethood. The initial shock led him to fear and uncertainty, but his wife Khadijah (RA) and her cousin Waraqah provided comfort and support, affirming the divine nature of the revelation.\n\nLiving in Makkah, the Prophet (pbuh) faced the challenge of spreading Islam in a society steeped in idolatry. The mission began discreetly, first at home and among close associates, including Khadijah (RA), Zaid bin Harithah (RA), 'Ali bin Abi Talib (RA), and Abu Bakr (RA). As the circle of converts expanded, the Prophet (pbuh) taught them in privacy, emphasizing secrecy. Revelation increased in speed, sometimes coming like the reverberations of a bell or with Jibreel (AS) appearing as a man. The early Muslims were continuously guided by verses focusing on subservience to Allah, the Hereafter, and Prophethood.\n\nThis period, marked by cultivation and preparation, instilled sincerity and steadfastness in the converts. Despite facing trials, persecution, and even death, they remained unwavering in their faith. The Prophet (pbuh) and his followers were being prepared for the imminent public proclamation of Islam, and the divine guidance during this time served to fortify their resolve and commitment to monotheism."

       "Combined_Content": "# The end of private propagation - 613 CE (10 BH):\nEven though the call was conducted in a clandestine manner and on an individual basis, it leaked out and began to attract wide public interest. At first, the leaders of Makkah cared little for Muhammad ﷺ's call likening him to a religious philosophiser, but such indifference soon altered once they realised the ramifications of his call.\nThe elite became particularly disturbed by his call to end idolatry, as for them it was through the status of Makkah being the hub of idol worship that it brought with it great economic standing. Thus Quraysh, the Makkan tribe, began to closely observe Muhammad ﷺ's  activities.\nProceeding three years of secret propagation, the Prophet had managed to cultivate a band of believers who emerged steadfast, imbued with the spirit of monotheism and activism. It was at this time that the angel Jibreel (AS) brought to the Prophet  further revelation; the command of Allah for Muhammad ﷺ  to openly confront his people, negate their creed, abolish idolatrous practices, and establish monotheism in word and deed - the time had now come to preach Islam openly.\nQuraysh would try to prevent the message spreading amongst the masses by scoffing, ridiculing, belying, and denouncing the Prophet as a man being insane, possessed by a spirit, or merely soothsayer or poet. However, such attempts only served to cause Muhammad ﷺ  to be even more steadfast in his call, so in a change of tactic, the Pagans invited him to compromise; whereby all would accept the religion of the other and worship all gods inclusively.\nOn realising the futility of all of their tactics, the pagans decided to implement an unrestrained campaign of resistance. They called for a general meeting and elected a committee of twenty five Quraishite nobles with Abu Lahab (the Prophet's uncle) as a chairman. Following discussions, they decided to utilise all channels of resistance at their disposal, from maligning the Messenger of Allah to the use of torture for the weak amongst his followers.\nThe Prophet had the support and protection of his compassionate uncle Abu Talib and his clan, which held the idolaters at bay to some extent. For instance, Abu Lahab would throw stones at the Prophet, made his two sons divorce their wives Ruqaiya (RA) and Umm Kulthum (RA), the Prophet's daughters, gloat over the death of the Prophet's second son calling him \"\"the man cut off from offspring\"\", and belie him openly during the pilgrimage seasons. This campaign continued for two years; only increasing in intensity.\nOther idolaters who were also related to the Prophet  indulged in the campaign of tyranny. Once whilst the Prophet  was prostrating by himself praying in the Ka'bah, Abu Jahl asked his companions to bring the dirty intestines of a she-camel and place it on his back at which 'Uqbah hastened to the ignoble deed. Whilst the infidels expressed their amusement at this depraved act, the Prophet's daughter, Fatimah (RA), removed the filth from her father's back and wept. The Prophet responded to her sorrow and said \"\"Don't worry, your Lord will take care of His Prophet\"\".\nEvery clan would target its own converts and would persecute them. Banu Makhzum took out 'Ammar ibn Yasir (RA) and his mother and father, who were all Muslims, into the midday heat. They tortured them and 'Ammar's (RA) mother, Sumayyah (RA) was killed in the process. She became the first martyr in the history of Islam.\nIn light of such inhuman persecutions, the Prophet advised the believers to conceal their conversion. He decided to meet with them secretly and took several measures to maintain their safety. He further avoided confrontation with the polytheists as the call was in its initial stages and the Muslims were still vulnerable, and some not even fully fledged.\nOne day the Muslims were on their way to the hillocks of Makkah to hold a clandestine meeting with the Prophet, when a group of polytheists noted their suspicious movement and began to abuse them. In defence, Sa'd bin Abi Waqqas (RA) struck one of the polytheists with the jawbone of a camel and wounded him. This was the first bloodshed in Islam. But after that the Prophet advised his companions to refrain from violence, until Allah decided otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n# The first migration - 614 CE (9 BH): \nAlthough the converts now hid their faith, the Prophet, on the other hand, would promulgate the Islamic faith and preach it openly with strong commitment and assiduous pursuit. But for the general welfare of the new converts and considering the strategic benefit to the new faith, he took Dar Al Arqam (the house of Al Arqam) in the Safa mountain as a provisional place where he would meet the believers, furtively instructing them with the Divine message from Allah and the Prophetic ways.\nThe oppressive nature of the idolaters intensified so much that torture and murder now became routine. Thus, Muhammad ﷺ directed the Muslims to escape to Abyssinia, the Christian kingdom-where \"\"a king rules without injustice, a land of truthfulness, until Allah leads us to a way out of our difficulty.\"\" Fearful of persecution and desiring to worship Allah in peace and freedom, a number of Muslims immigrated to Abyssinia upon the Prophet's advice.\nIn the month of Rajab, twelve men and four women, headed by ‘Uthman ibn Affan (RA) and his wife Ruqayyah (RA), the daughter of the Prophet, secretly left Makkah. They were also the first family to immigrate for the sake of Allah since the Prophets Ibrahim (AS) and Lut (AS) immigrated with their households. The immigrants made their way to a port south of Jeddah, and managed to secure two merchant ships that took them to Abyssinia where they lived under the protection of the Negus, with freedom to worship, until they heard a rumour that the Quraysh had converted.\nHowever, the news that reached them was not as it seemed, and when they returned, they found the Quraysh to be even more fervent in their persecution of the believers. Some of the believers returned to Abysinnia, and others secretly stayed in Makkah.\n With intensified oppression, the Prophet advised emigration once more, and this time eighty two or eighty three men, and eighteen women departed. This larger group of Muslims arrived in Abyssinia despite all efforts exerted by the Pagans to stop them, and so, Quraysh sent Amr ibn Al 'Aas and Abdullah ibn Rabi'ah to reason with the king and ensure the return of the emigrants.\nThe King summoned the emigrants and questioned them concerning what the two emissaries had said. It was with great courage and eloquence that Ja'far (RA) responded on behalf of the believers to the kings question about their new religion. He said,\nO king, we were a people steeped in ignorance, worshipping idols, eating unsacrificed carrion, committing abominations, and the strong would devour the weak. Thus we were, until Allah sent us a messenger from out our midst, one whose lineage we knew, and his veracity and his worthiness of trust and his integrity. He called us unto Allah, that we should testify to His Oneness and worship Him alone and renounce what we and our fathers had worshipped, and he commanded us to speak truly, to fulfil our promises, to respect the ties of kinship and the rights of our neighbours, and to refrain from crimes and from bloodshed...For these reasons have our people turned against us, and have persecuted us to forsake our religion and revert from the worship of Allah to the worship of idols. That is why we came to thy country, having chosen thee above all others.\nHe then recited to the Negus some verses from the Quranic chapter of Mary whereupon the king and his bishops began to weep. The king then swore that he would not deliver them to Quraysh.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Conversion of Hamza and Umar (RA) - 615 CE (8 BH): \nThe conversion of Hamzah (RA) and Umar (RA) did much to further the cause of the religion, and it was by these two men that Allah restored a sense of honour and pride to the believers.\nHamzah (RA)'s conversion, although initially proclaimed out of anger due to the oppression of his kin, proved to be extremely fruitful in strengthening Islam and the Muslims. It came about through an incidence that occurred at the Ka'bah between the Prophet who was one day seated on the hillock of Safa when Abu Jahl passed by and insulted Islam.\nThe Prophet kept quiet choosing not to engage Abu Jahl in his vain talk, an act which incensed him, so he took a stone and struck the Prophet's head which began to bleed. Abu Jahl then left to join the Quraysh at their assembly place. Hamzah (RA) happened to be returning from a hunting trip when a slave-girl belonging to 'Abdullah bin Jad'an, informed him of what had happened.\nOn being deeply offended, he hastened to the Ka'bah where he found the aggressor sitting in the courtyard of the Holy Sanctuary. Hamzah (RA) rushed upon him and violently struck Abu Jahl on the head saying: \"\"Ah! You insult Muhammad ﷺ when I too follow his religion?!\"\"\nHis conversion proved to be a source of great strength to the Islamic Faith and its adherents, and he himself came to be known as the 'Lion of Allah'.\nThe Conversion of 'Umar bin Al-Khattab (RA) took place three days subsequent to the conversion of Hamzah (RA). He was at this time about twenty-six years old, a man of courage who was feared and respected with decisive resolution. Unlike his uncle Abu Jahal he was deeply pious and as such, though a bitter opponent of the new religion, would at times feel various contradictory emotions within his soul.\nAn example of this is once when 'Umar (RA) was in the Holy Sanctuary where he saw the Prophet offering prayer. He thought it would be a good idea to hide behind the curtain of the Ka'bah and jump out and Muhammad ﷺ to scare him. However, as he got closer, he could hear him reciting the Quranic chapter Al-Haqqah and was amazed by the words of Allah, but being irrational he thought to himself, 'this must be the words of an exceptional poet', and which the Prophet recited the verse, \"\"It is not the word of a poet, little is that you believe!\"\"\nShocked at the Prophet's statement and quite certain that the Prophet knew nothing of his presence he thought to himself the Prophet must be a soothsayer. But as the thought crossed his mind, the Prophet recited, \"\"Nor is it the word of a foreteller, little is that you remember!\"\" The Prophet continued, \"\"This is the Revelation sent down from the Lord of the worlds.\"\" Although Islam had now permeated his heart, the deep-seated bigotry he held, rendered him unable to submit to the truth, and thus, persisted in his oppression of Muslims, filled with loathing.\nHis sharp temper and excessive enmity towards Muhammad ﷺ led him one day to hunt for him, with a sword in hand, he left his home. However, he didn't get far when he was informed that his brother-in-law and his sister had abandoned polytheism in favour of Islam. So 'Umar (RA) changed his course setting it towards his sister's house. As he drew near, he could hear the Quran being recited and entered angrily and uninvited. Full of rage he fell upon his brother-in-law beating him severely, but Fatimah (RA), his sister rushed to the rescue of her husband when 'Umar (RA) fell upon his sister and struck her on her head. Realising fighting back was futile the couple cried out, \"\"Yes, we are Muslims, we believe in Allah and His Messenger Muhammad ﷺ so do as you will.\"\"\nUpon seeing the face of his sister besmeared with blood he felt regret, full of shame. He said softly, as if to extend an olive branch, \"\"Let me see what you were reading, so that I may see what Muhammad ﷺ has brought.\"\" They complied with his request but only after they had made him wash, since he was unclean. Upon doing so he was given the parchment which he took and began to read, from the opening verses of the Chapter Ta-Ha until he reached, \"\"Verily! I am Allah, none has the right to be worshipped but I, so worship Me and offer prayers for My Remembrance.\"\" 'Umar (RA) read the verses with awe, and the seed of Islam had finally began to sprout in his heart: \"\"How excellent it is, and how graceful! Please guide me to Muhammad ﷺ.\"\" he said.\nOn hearing his statement, Khabbab (RA) came out of concealment and said, \"\"O 'Umar (RA), I hope that Allah has answered the prayer of the Prophet , for I heard him say, \"\"O Allah! Strengthen Islam through the one most beloved to you, either 'Umar bin Al-Khattab (RA) or Abu Jahl bin Hisham.\"\"\n'Umar (RA) then left for Dar Al Arqam where the Prophet  had been holding secret meetings along with his Companions (RA). 'Umar (RA) reached there with his sword swinging by his arm. He knocked at the door and the Companions (RA) of the Prophet turned to see who the intruder was. One of them peeped through a chink in the door and shrieked, \"\"It's 'Umar (RA) with his sword.\"\" Hamzah (RA), being the Lion he was, said, \"\"Open the door. If he intends good he shall find it here, and if he intends evil, he will be killed with his own sword.\"\"\nOn entering he stated his intentions saying, \"\"O Messenger of Allahﷺ , I come to you in order to believe in Allah and his Messenger and that which he has brought from his Lord.\"\" Filled with delight, all cried out 'Allah is Great' so loud that even those in the Holy Sanctuary heard.\n'Umar (RA)'s conversion had a tremendous impact on the situation of the believers. ‘Abdullah Ibn Al-'Abbas (RA) related that he had asked 'Umar bin Al-Khattab (RA) why he had been given the epithet of Al-Faruq (he who distinguishes truth from falsehood), he replied, \"\"After I had embraced Islam, I asked the Prophet:\n'Aren't we on the right path in this world and the hereafter?' The Prophet answered: 'Of course you are! I swear by Allah in Whose Hand my soul is, that you are right in this world and in the hereafter.' I, therefore, asked the Prophet  why we then had to conduct our activities secretly. \"\"I swear by Allah Who has sent you with the Truth, that we will leave our concealment and proclaim our noble cause publicly.\"\"\nWe then went out in two groups, Hamzah (RA) leading one and I the other. We headed for the Mosque in broad daylight and when the polytheists of Quraysh saw us, their faces became pale with resentment. On that very occasion, the Prophet  attached to me the epithet of Al Faruq.",
       "Stage_summary": "During this crucial period of Prophet Muhammad's (pbuh) life, he faced increasing opposition and persecution from the Quraysh in Makkah.\n\nThe oppression intensified, leading to the first bloodshed in Islam when Sa'd bin Abi Waqqas (RA) defended the believers. The Prophet advised concealment of their faith and held secret meetings to protect the converts though he himself (pbuh) continued to openly preach monotheism despite the challenges and sought protection from his uncle Abu Talib. The campaign of tyranny included Abu Jahl's infamous acts, and Banu Makhzum's torture resulted in the first martyr, Sumayyah (RA).\n\nIn response to persecution, the Prophet advised the first emigration to Abyssinia, where believers lived peacefully under the Negus's protection. However, a false rumor about Quraysh's conversion led to their return, facing increased persecution. The Prophet then advised a second emigration, and a larger group, including 'Uthman ibn Affan (RA) and Ruqayyah (RA), migrated to Abyssinia, securing safety despite Quraysh's efforts.\n\nThe conversion of Hamzah (RA) and 'Umar (RA) towards the end of this period marked a turning point in Islam. Their acceptance of Islam, particularly Hamzah's, provided strength and courage to the Muslim community, earning him the title \"Lion of Allah.\" 'Umar's conversion brought strategic leadership, contributing significantly to Islam's spread. These conversions signaled that Islam was gaining ground even among the most powerful opposition and attracting people from all walks of life."

       "Combined_Content": "# Quraysh take Action - 616 CE (7 BH):\nQuraysh gathered together having reached the end of their tether to confer on how best to proceed from Muhammad ﷺ's refusal to cooperate. They drew up a document in which they vowed to boycott Banu Hashim and the Banu al Muttalib whereby they would not marry their women, nor give women in marriage to them, or sell anything to them or buy anything from them. They drew up this written contract and solemnly pledged themselves to observe it hanging it up in the interior of the Ka'bah so as to make it even more binding.\nThis caused Banu Hashim and the Banu al-Muttalib to join Abu Talib to retreat into his valley, but Abu Lahab, also from the Banu Hashim, abandoned his clan and instead sided with Quraysh supporting them against Prophet Muhammad ﷺ and his allies.\"\n\n\n\n\n# Boycotting the muslim community - 617 CE (6 BH):\nHaving withdrawn to a valley on the eastern outskirts of Makkah, the believers found themselves part of the stifling siege. The supply of food was almost stopped and the people in confinement faced great hardships. The idolaters used to buy whatever food commodities entered Makkah so as to ensure those who were being boycotted wouldn't receive any. The boycotted were so overstrained that they eventually began to eat leaves of trees and skins of animals in order to survive.\nCries of little children suffering from hunger could be heard. It was only on a few occasions that meagre quantities of food would be smuggled to them by some compassionate Makkans. During 'the prohibited months' when hostilities traditionally ceased, they would leave their confinement and buy food coming from outside Makkah, although, food stuff was unjustly overpriced so that their financial situation would still make them fall short.\nDespite all odds, the Prophet persisted in his call with his determination and bravery never being weakened. He continued to go to the Ka'bah to pray publicly and used every opportunity to preach to outsiders who visited Makkah for business or on pilgrimage during the sacred months.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n# The boycott is Revoked - 618 CE (5 BH):\nThe boycott created much dissent amongst the various Makkan tribes who were connected to the besieged by way of blood relations. It had moreover the undesired and unforeseen effect of drawing further attention to the Prophet and of causing the new religion to be talked of more than ever throughout Arabia.\nIn the month of Muharram, after nearly three years, the pact was finally broken. From the  motivation of by blood relations, there emerged a group of five people who set out to abrogate the pact and declare all relevant clauses null and void. They were Hisham bin 'Amr who so often would send camels laden with food and clothes for the boycotted, Zuhair bin Abi Umayyah, Al-Mut'im bin 'Adi, Abu Al Bukhtari and Zam'a bin Al Aswad. They decided to meet in their assembly place and initiated their mission from the very precinct of the Sacred House.\nZuhair, after circumambulating seven times around the Ka'bah, approached the gatherings of people there and reproved them for indulging whilst their relatives from Banu Hashim were suffering under starvation and economic boycott. The other four accomplices then stood up one after the other, in a staged event, showing their support for him and denouncing those who spoke against Zuhair. Although the five tried their best, Abu Jahl hastily tried to dissuade the audience in order to ward of their noble attempts, and began to accuse them of having plotted it all overnight.\nMut'im cut him short by going into the Ka'bah to fetch the document. He came out in triumph with a small piece of vellum in his hand: the worms had eaten the ban, all but the opening words \"\"In Thy Name, O Allah\"\".\nMost of Quraysh had been virtually won over already, and this unquestionable omen was a final and altogether decisive argument. Abu Jahl and one or two likeminded men knew that it would be in vain to resist. The ban was formally revoked, and a body of Quraysh went to give the good news to Bani Hashim and Bani al-Muttalib.\nAlthough tensions in Makkah were relaxed, after the ban was lifted hostilities against the Muslims still continued. The leaders of the Quraysh continued to try and persuade the Prophet to agree to a compromise; even proposing that they should all practice both religions. Their efforts were in vain as the Prophet could not and would not compromise on matters of faith and clear Divine guidance.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n# The year of Deep sorrow - 619 CE (4 BH):\nThe difficulties of the Prophet and his followers did not come to an end after the annulment of the ban. Six months after the end of the boycott Abu Talib fell ill and it soon became clear that he was dying. The strain of the boycott had proved too heavy for him. It was at this time that a deputation of Quraysh visited him at his deathbed. It was here that they inclined to offer terms of peace to Muhammad ﷺ on the condition that he refrained from criticising their faith and their gods. However, there could be no such agreement for the Prophet as 'there was no god but Allah, and all other gods were false'.\nThe Prophet then longed for his uncle to accept Islam and so he called upon him once again to embrace it. He seemed to lend him an ear but was cut short by Abu Lahab and his ilk and so he stuck to the religion of his people and died upon this.\nA short while after the death of Abu Talib, Khadijah (RA), the wife of the Prophet; the Mother of the believers, also passed away. The deaths of Abu Talib and Khadijah (RA) marked the end of an era. Abu Talib had been more than a father to the Prophet, and in spite of the strong pressure of Quraysh, he had protected him to the last breath, even leaving a bequest in his favour.\nKhadijah (RA) had been for the Prophet more than wife. She placed her wealth at his disposal, never faltering she showered him with love, honour, and support. Not only was she the mother of his children, she was also his most sincere advisor and an ardent believer.\nThe passing away of Abu Talib and Khadijah (RA) created a great vacuum in the life of the Prophet. The loneliness he once felt in the cave of Hira had returned. The intensity of his grief was so great that the year of the deaths of Abu Talib and Khadijah (RA) came to be known as the 'Year of Sorrow'.\nThese two painful events took place within a short space of time and added to his grief. The Makkans, now with the Prophet's protector absent, openly declared their campaign of torture and oppression. It was then that he decided to seek help from Thaqif, the people of Ta'if - the guardians of the temple goddess al-Lat.\nIn the month of Shawwal, Muhammad ﷺ set out towards Ta'if, about sixty kilometres from Makkah. He approached the welcoming orchards and gardens and cornfields in the company of his freed slave Zaid bin Harithah (RA) inviting people to Islam. contrary to his expectations, the general atmosphere was that of hostility. He approached various notables, all of whom rejected his call.\nHe remained amongst them for ten days, but all to no purpose. Stirred up to hasten the departure of the unwelcome visitor, the people hooted him through the alleyways, pelted him with stones and obliged him to flee from the city pursued by a relentless rabble. Blood flowed down his body; and Zaid (RA), endeavouring to shield him, was also wounded in the head. The mob would not desist until they had chased him two or three miles across the sandy plains to the foot of the surrounding hills. There, wearied and exhausted, he took refuge in one of the numerous orchards, and rested against the wall of a vineyard.\n\n\n\n\n\n# Wonderment and hope - 620 CE (3 BH):\nIn the year that followed the Year of Sadness, the pilgrimage fell at the beginning of summer; it had been the Prophet's practice now for several years to visit the various groups and to declare his message to any who would listen, reciting for them verses of the revelations.\nThe nearest point from Mina to Mecca is 'Aqabah, where the road rises up steeply from the valley towards the hills in the direction of the Holy city; and it was this year at 'Aqabah that the Prophet came upon six men of the tribe of Khazraj, from Yathrib. He told them about Islam and called on them to submit to Islamic monotheism. Their faces lit up with interest; and they listened to him intently saying to one another, \"\"By Allah, this is the same thing that the Jews informed us; Indeed, nobody should now get ahead of us.\"\" They accepted his teachings and embraced Islam. They also said to the Prophet, \"\"We have left our people, for there are no people so torn asunder by enmity and evil as they; and it may be that Allah will unite them through you. We will now go to them and summon them to accept the religion as we have accepted it; and if Allah unites them together through you, then no man will be more honoured than you\"\".\nThe six men of Khazraj delivered the message of Islam to as many of their people as would listen to them; and the next summer, five of them repeated their pilgrimage, bringing with them seven others, two of whom were from the tribe of Aws. At 'Aqabah, these twelve men pledged themselves to the Prophet, and this pledge is known as the First 'Aqabah:\n\"\"We pledged our allegiance to the Messenger of Allah on the night of the First 'Aqabah, that we would associate nothing with Allah as partner, that we would neither commit theft nor fornication, nor to kill their own children, and we would obey him in what was right.\"\"\nWhen these people left for Madinah, the Prophet sent Musab Ibn Umayr (RA) with them to teach the Qur'an to the people there to expound Islam and instruct them about the religion.\nThe timing of the call was perfect since it took place at a critical juncture when Allah afforded the opportunity of helping and defending Islam to both the Aws and the Khazraj, and in effect, crushed their own petty squabbling. It was by various causes and circumstances such as this that Almighty Allah opened the door of acceptance by those who were inherently kind-hearted and sweet-tempered, immune from the Quraishite traits of immoderation, stubbornness and vanity, and hence the people of Yathrib were responsive and open to reason.\"",
       "Stage_summary": "This period in the life of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) was marked by intense challenges and trials. The Quraysh, frustrated by Muhammad's refusal to compromise on his message, imposed a boycott on Banu Hashim and Banu al-Muttalib, leading to a harsh siege. The believers faced starvation and economic hardship, resorting to desperate measures such as eating leaves and animal skins.\n\nAfter nearly three years, the boycott was broken by a group motivated by blood relations, highlighting the unintended consequences of drawing attention to the Prophet and Islam. Despite the relief, hostilities continued in Makkah. The deaths of Abu Talib and Khadijah (RA) left a significant void, making it the \"Year of Sorrow.\"\n\nIn seeking support, the Prophet faced rejection in Ta'if, enduring hostility and persecution. The pilgrimage following this difficult period marked a pivotal moment, as six men from Yathrib (later known as Medina) pledged allegiance to the Prophet in what became the First Aqabah. This event laid the foundation for the migration to Medina, where the people were more receptive to Islam, leading to the eventual establishment of the Muslim community."

       "Combined_Content": "# The night of ascension - 621 CE (2 BH):\nThe Prophet ﷺ loved to visit the Ka'bah and one night after praying he was overcome with sleep, and he lay down beside it.\n\"\"Whilst I was sleeping in the Hijr,\"\" he said, \"\"Jibreel (AS) came to me and spurred me with his foot whereupon I sat upright.\"\" The angel then cut open his body from the top of the chest downwards. He then took out the Prophet's heart and washed it is a golden basin and then filled it with faith and sealed his body. He then led him out to the gate of the Mosque, and there was a white beast named Buraq, between a mule and an ass, with large wings either side and his every stride was as far his eye could see. The Prophet was carried on it, and Jibreel (AS) set out with him till they reached the Jerusalem at speed. Then they were met by a group of Prophets - Ibrahim (AS), Musa (AS), E'sa (AS) and others - and when he prayed on the site of the holy Mosque, they gathered behind him for prayer.\nThen, Muhammad ﷺ was taken up to Heaven. Led by the Archangel, who now revealed himself as a heavenly being, they ascended beyond earthly space and time, and as they passed through the Heavens they met some of the Prophets. Each time he met another Prophet he would extend greetings to them and they would reply, \"\"you are welcomed, O pious son and pious Prophet.\"\"\nThen he was made to ascend to Sidrat-ul-Muntaha (the Lote Tree of the utmost boundary). Its fruits were like the jars of Hajr (a place near Medina) and its leaves were as big as the ears of elephants. Jibreel (AS) said: 'This is the Lote Tree of the utmost boundary.' There ran four rivers; two were hidden and two were visible. The Prophet ﷺ asked, 'what are these two kinds of rivers, O Jibreel (AS)?' He replied, 'as for the hidden rivers, they are two rivers in Paradise and the visible rivers are the Nile and the Euphrates.'\nThen Al-Bait-ul-Mamur (the Sacred House) was shown to him and a container full of wine, another full of milk, and a third full of honey were brought to the Prophet ﷺ; he took the milk. Jibreel (AS) remarked: 'This is the Islamic religion which you and your followers are following.'\nThen fifty prayers were enjoined on the Prophet at which Musa (AS) remarked, 'Your followers cannot bear fifty prayers a day, and by Allah I have tested people before you, and I have tried my level best with the Children of Israel (in vain). Go back to your Lord and ask for reduction to lessen your followers' burden.' So the Prophet ﷺ returned continuously, until he was ordered to observe five prayers a day. The Prophet ﷺ was then transported back to his earthly station.\n\n\n\n\n\n# Help arrives from Madinah - 622 CE (1 BH): \nThe thirteenth year saw a greater number of pilgrims from Yathrib; seventy-three men and two women. Secretly, Muhammad ﷺ contacted the leaders of the group and they agreed to meet at ‘Aqaba during the night on the second day following the pilgrimage. The Muslims of Yathrib kept the meeting secret stealing themselves away under the cover of the night. When they reached ‘Aqaba, men and women ascended the mountain awaiting the arrival of the Prophet.\nThe Prophet arrived with his uncle 'Abbas (RA) who had not yet converted to Islam. He knew from his nephew that this meeting was to conclude an alliance which might incite Quraysh to a war of aggression as much as it was designed to achieve peace and security. Muhammad ﷺ had informed his uncle that together with some members of Banu Al Muttalib and Banu Hashim he had agreed with the new group from Yathrib that they would protect him personally. Anxious to strengthen his nephew and people against a war whose losses might fall heavily upon Banu Hashim and Banu Al Muttalib, Abbas sought to make sure that among this group from Yathrib he would find real helpers and allies.\nConsequently, he was the first one to open the discussion. He said, \"\"O men from Khazraj, Muhammad ﷺ's eminence and prestige among us are known to you. We have protected him even against those of his own people who think as highly of him as we do. Among us, he stands strong and secure. But he insists on joining your party. If you find yourselves capable of fulfilling toward him what you have promised, then you may proceed. But if you would betray him and send him over to his enemies once he has joined your party, you had better now say so and leave him alone.\"\"\nAfter hearing this speech of 'Abbas (RA), the men from Yathrib said, \"\"We have heard what you said, O 'Abbas (RA),\"\" and turning to the Prophet, they continued, \"\"O Prophet, speak out and choose for yourself and your Lord what you desire.\"\" Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, after reciting some verses from the Quran, preached his faith in Allah in moving terms. He then said to the men from Yathrib, \"\"I covenant with you on the condition that you will protect me against all, just as you would protect your women and children.\"\"\nAl Bara (RA) said, \"\"We have covenanted with you, O Prophet. By Allah, we are men of many wars; we are men of the sword, having inherited it from father unto son.\"\" Before Al Bara (RA) finished his words, Abu al Haytham (RA) said, \"\"O Prophet, there are pacts between us and some Jews which we are going to denounce. Should your cause succeed later or among your own tribe, would you return to them and leave us alone?\"\" Muhammad ﷺ smiled and said, \"\"No! Rather, your blood is my blood and your destruction is my destruction. You are of me and I am of you. I shall fight whomsoever you fight and make peace with whomsoever you will make peace.\"\"\nThe people were about to rise and give covenant to Muhammad ﷺ when 'Abbas (RA) interrupted and said, \"\"O men of Khazraj! Are you fully aware of what you are about to covenant with this man? You are about to covenant with him to make war against all sorts of men without discrimination. If you have any fear that, should you lose your wealth and should your leaders fall by the sword, you might betray Muhammad ﷺ, say so now and withdraw from this covenant. For if you do not and then betray your oath, you will have lost in this world as well as the next. But if you feel certain that you can stand by him and fulfil this oath, notwithstanding the loss of your property and the murder of your dear ones, then go ahead and covenant with him. He is, by Allah, the best gain in this world and in the next.\"\"\nAll the people present answered together, \"\"We take him despite all threats to property, wealth and life. Tell us, O Prophet, what will be our reward' if we remain true to this oath?\"\" He answered, \"\"Paradise.\"\" They stretched out their hands to him, and he to them, and the covenant was concluded. Thereafter, the Prophet said, \"\"Elect among yourselves twelve representatives who will be responsible to me regarding your behaviour and conduct.\"\" After they elected nine from Al Khazraj and three from Al Aws, the Prophet addressed them in the following words, \"\"You are the guarantors of your people, just as the disciples were guarantors of theirs before Jesus, Son of Mary. I, for my part, am the guarantor of my people.\"\"\nSuch was their second covenant which included the words, \"\"We have covenanted to listen and to obey in health and in sickness, in fortune and misfortune, to tell the truth wherever we might be and, at all times, to fear none in the cause of Allah.\"\"",
       "Stage_summary": "In this period of Prophet Muhammad's (pbuh) life, a significant spiritual event occurred known as the Isra and Mi'raj. During the night, the Angel Jibreel (AS) visited the Prophet while he slept near the Ka'bah. Jibreel (AS) opened his chest, cleansed his heart with faith, and sealed his body. They then embarked on a miraculous journey on the celestial creature Buraq, meeting several Prophets in the heavens, culminating in the Prophet reaching the Lote Tree of the utmost boundary and being shown Al-Bait-ul-Mamur. The Prophet received the command of fifty daily prayers, later reduced to five after consultation with Prophet Musa (AS).\n\nAnother crucial event took place in the thirteenth year, marked by the pledge at 'Aqaba. Seventy-three men and two women from Yathrib pledged allegiance to the Prophet, agreeing to protect him as they would their own families. 'Abbas (RA), the Prophet's uncle, emphasized the gravity of the commitment, ensuring the sincerity of the alliance. The people of Yathrib pledged to stand by the Prophet in peace and war, accepting the risk of losing wealth and lives. The covenant concluded with the Prophet promising them Paradise as their reward. Representatives were elected to ensure the fulfillment of the covenant, reminiscent of the disciples' role with Jesus (AS). This covenant emphasized obedience, truthfulness, and fearlessness in the cause of Allah."

       "year_hijri": "1 AH",
       "Combined_Content": "After the hajj pilgrimage, the new converts from Yathrib returned home to await the arrival of the Muslim fugitives. In Makkah Muhammad ﷺ began to persuade the believers to migrate, but stopped short of commanding it. It was an irrevocable and frightening step and anybody who felt it to be beyond his or her strength, was free to remain behind.\nDuring  the summer in 622 CE, about seventy Muslims set off with their families to Madinah, where they were lodged in the houses of the Ansar, the Muslims of Madinah, until they could set up their own homes.\nWhen Quraysh realised the plan, they sought to prevent certain individuals from leaving; though they fell short of a concerted effort to detain the Muslims. They saw the departure of Muhammad ﷺ as a serious threat, fearing that under his wise and farsighted leadership, the people of Yathrib might even seek to attack Makkah, or at least, cut off their trade route to Sham. Hence, the Quraysh decided that there was really no alternative but rid of themselves of this nuisance once and for all. They concluded at the Nadwah (meeting house) that the best solution would be for each one of their clans to delegate a strong youth and arm him with a sharp sword so that they would all kill Muhammad ﷺ together with one stroke; and therefore, the responsibility for his death would be equally divided amongst them all, thus making vengeance on the part of Banu 'Abd Manaf, the clan of the Prophet, virtually impossible.\nWhen the iniquitous resolution had been passed, the angel Jibreel (AS) came to Muhammad ﷺ and revealed to him their plot. He then gave him Allah's permission to leave Makkah, bidding him to leave that night and not sleep in his bed. At noon, the Prophet went to inform his companion Abu Bakr (RA) who at once knew that the time had come to leave Makkah. His daughter, 'Aisha (RA), saw the delight in her fathers eyes at the prospect of accompanying the Prophet as they sat and made their plans. The Prophet then returned to his house and told 'Ali (RA) that he was about to leave for Yathrib and that he should stay behind in Makkah in order to give back all the goods which had been entrusted to the Prophet. As night advanced, the Quraysh posted assassins around the Prophet's house. Thus they kept vigil all night long, waiting to kill him the moment he left his house early in the morning.\nThe Prophet and 'Ali (RA) were soon aware of their presence; and the Prophet took up a cloak in which he used to sleep and gave it to 'Ali (RA), telling him to sleep in it and that no harm would come to him. Just before dawn, Muhammad ﷺ left without being noticed; he cast a handful of dust at the assassins and managed to work his way through them reciting verses of the Noble Quran, \"And We have put a barrier before them, and a barrier behind them, and We have covered them up, so that they cannot see.\" Then together along with Abu Bakr (RA) they left for Madinah southward towards the cave of Thawr.\nFor three long days, the pair remained in the cave and the Quraysh persistently looked for them without avail. Nobody knew of their hiding place in the cave except the family of Abu Bakr (RA). On the third day the silence of their mountain sanctuary was broken by the faint sound of men's voices gradually drawing closer. As they approached their hideout the Prophet looked at Abu Bakr (RA), and said: \"Do not fear; Allah is with us.\" They could now hear the sound of footsteps which drew nearer and then stopped: the assassins were standing outside the cave. They then turned back; all in agreement that there was no need to enter the cave, since no one could possibly be there. To their amazement the two climbed up to the mouth of the cave to find its entrance covered with a spiders web.\nWhen they felt certain that Quraysh had called off the hunt for them in the vicinity, Muhammad ﷺ and Abu Bakr (RA) commanded their servant to bring them their camels for a final escape. Together with their servant and guide they headed south towards Madinah taking unknown paths to cover their tracks.\nMeanwhile, Quraysh declared a hundred camels as a reward for whoever would bring back Muhammad ﷺ, dead or alive. Such an immense sum spurred many individuals to try their luck, from amongst them was Suraqah ibn Malik (RA). Upon hearing that the Prophet  had been spotted, he decided to pursue him, secretly mounting a swift horse and riding northwest. As he caught sight of them his horse began to stumble and continued to do so a number of times. He conceded that this was indeed a bad omen, however, with the prize in mind he obstinately continued. Now so close that he could hear the Prophet reciting verses of the Quran the two forelegs of his horse began to sink into the sand causing Suraqah to fall off; awakened to the situation,he realized his inability in the face of divine protection. He approached the travelling group with a penitent heart and begged of the Prophet  for forgiveness in all humility. The Prophet forgave him and asked him to keep their matter a secret. Suraqah hurried back to Makkah a Muslim and tried to foil the attempts of those who were in pursuit of Muhammad ﷺ.\nFor seven consecutive days they travelled with great haste under the cover of night until they reached the quarters of Banu Sabin, close to Madinah. Their fears lessened and for the first time, their hearts delighted with the hope and assurance of victory. They had almost reached their destination.\nDuring Prophet Muhammad ﷺ's  long and exhaustive trip, the news reached his companions in Yathrib that he had emigrated from Makkah in order to join them. Aware of the enmity of Quraysh and of their attempts to follow and seize the Prophet, the Muslims waited anxiously for his arrival and looked forward to hearing the details of his escape. Many of them had never seen the Prophet  before, although they had heard a great deal about his message and resolution.  For many days before his arrival, they would go out to the outskirts of the city at dawn to spend the morning seeking signs of the Prophet's arrival at a place called al-Harrah. \n Abu Bakr (RA) and Muhammad ﷺ  had now reached the town of Quba on the outskirts of Madinah were they stayed for a few days. During this interval, he founded a Mosque and before he left for Medina, 'Ali (RA) had joined his party.\nOn Monday 27 September 622 CE, as the Muslims awaited the arrival of Muhammad ﷺ, a Jew of Yathrib announced to them,\"O People of Arabia, your man has finally arrived.\" A joyous cry swept Madinah as the news soon spread through the city and people left their homes wearing their best attire to receive their noble guest. Yathrib, would now be known as Madinah (which is a shortening of Madinatu Nabi, or City of the Prophet).\nA number of notables invited the Prophet to stay with them but the Prophet  respectfully declined and for fairness allowed his camel to stroll freely through the city. It continued until it stopped at an enclosure belonging to two orphans of Banu al Najjar which he bought from them. There, the Prophet's Mosque was built in earnest, along with the his living quarters.\nThe Emigrants and residence built the Mosque from the trunk of palm trees that were used as pillars to support a roof of palm branches, and a greater part of the courtyard was left open. But the Emigrants and the Helpers, as the residence of Madinah would now be known, needed a more formal bond than simply a song and a shared activity. The Prophet enjoined upon the two parties a tie of brotherhood, pairing each of them into a bond that would supersede past tribal ties; the Quraysh, the Madani tribes of Aws and Kasraj, now formed one Ummah. Islam was building a force for unity and seeking to eradicate all  division.",
       "Stage_summary": "After the hajj pilgrimage, Prophet Muhammad ﷺ encouraged believers to migrate to Madinah, facing increasing opposition from Quraysh. The Quraysh, realizing the threat, planned to assassinate Muhammad ﷺ, but the angel Jibreel (AS) informed him, allowing a swift and secret escape.\n\nMuhammad ﷺ, accompanied by Abu Bakr (RA), sought refuge in a cave, eluding Quraysh's pursuit. Quraysh even offered a reward for his capture, but divine protection thwarted their efforts. Suraqah ibn Malik, one of the pursuers, experienced multiple obstacles and eventually embraced Islam.\n\nFor seven days, Muhammad ﷺ and Abu Bakr (RA) traveled covertly, reaching Quba on the outskirts of Madinah. The city eagerly awaited his arrival, and on September 27, 622 CE, Madinah joyfully welcomed the Prophet ﷺ, marking the migration's success.\n\nRather than accepting the hospitality of the elite, Muhammad ﷺ chose a humble place, where the Prophet's Mosque was later built. He fostered unity by establishing brotherhood bonds between Emigrants and Helpers, eradicating tribal divisions and laying the foundation for a united Ummah."

       "year_ce": "623 CE",
       "year_hijri": "2 AH",
       "Combined_Content": "As soon as the Muslims undertook the Hijra they knew that they would have to be prepared to fight.\nAs mentioned early on, the ghazu or raid was an accepted way of making ends meet, among the Arabs, when times were hard.  Raiders would invade the territory of an enemy tribe and capture their livestock and other goods, taking care to avoid bloodshed. Madinah was ideally placed to attack the Makkan caravans, often guarded by only a few merchants. Muhammad ﷺ despatched two raiding parties of Emigrants,  to attack their caravans because  the Quraysh had usurped the wealth they left behind when fleeing Makkah. These early raids were not entirely successful but sent a clear message to the Makkans of defiance.\nThe raids didn't deter Abu Sufyan (RA) who led a great caravan towards Sham; the goods were estimated at 50,000 dinars with all the Makkan merchants having bought a share in it. The Muslims received the news of the caravan and the Prophet set out with three hundred odd men to intercept it at the well of Badr, near the Red Sea coast. Abu Sufyan (RA) caught wind of the ambush and instead of taking his usual route across the Hijaz, he turned sharply away from the coast and dispatched a local tribesman to Mecca to get help.The change of plan proved successful as he managed to elude the Muslims and take the caravan beyond their reach. He sent word that the merchandise was safe and that military help was no longer needed. But Abu Jahl would have none of this. \"By Allah!\" he cried. \"We will not go back until we have been to Badr. We will spend three days there, slaughter camels, and feast and drink wine. The Arabs will hear that we have come and will respect us in the future.\" But not even Abu Jahl was expecting a full fledged battle.\nWhen news reached the Muslims that the Quraysh had come out in force, the Prophet called a council of war as the Muslim volunteers had come out to take part in a Ghazu (raid), not a pitched battle.\nAfter Abu Bakr (RA) and Umar (RA) presented their views, Miqdad ibn Amr (RA) stood up and said:\n\"O Prophet of Allah ﷺ, press forward toward that which Allah has shown you. We are with you. By Allah, we shall never say to you, as the Jews had said to Moses, 'Go alone with your Allah and fight with Him for us, while we remain here and await your return.' Rather, we say, 'Go forth, you and your Allah to fight, for we fight with you'.\"\nAl Miqdad's (RA) speech, on behalf of the Emigrants, was followed by silence. The Prophet said: \"Speak out, O men, and give me your counsel.\" He was especially anxious to hear the Ansar's view who, on the day of Aqaba, pledged to protect him as they would their children and women but not to permit any aggression with him outside their own area. When the Ansar realized that he was waiting for them to speak, Sa'd ibn Mu'adh (RA), their leader, rose and addressed the Prophet:\n\"Does it seem, O Prophet of Allah ﷺ, that you are seeking to hear our view?\" The Prophet answered, \"Indeed.\"\nSa'd (RA) said, \"We have believed in you, and we have witnessed that what you have brought to us is the truth. We have covenanted with you to hear and to obey. Go ahead with whatever you decide, for we are with you. By Him who sent you as a Prophet, if you were to ask us to cross the sea and you plunged into it, we would plunge into it with you, and not a man would stay behind. We do not fear that you cause us to face our enemy tomorrow. We shall hold fast to our ground and stand firm or press forward toward the enemy in solid ranks. We hope that Allah will show you such of our deeds as you may not be disappointed therein but may be proud of. Lead us forth with Allah's blessing.\"\nSa'd (RA) had hardly finished when the Prophet's  face radiated with joy saying, \"Proceed and be hopeful, for Allah had promised me one of the two: either the caravan or the Makkan army.\" Ali (RA), al Zubayr (RA), and Sa’d (RA) were dispatched with a number of other companions to the well of Badr to seek out fresh news. The group returned with two water-carriers who revealed that  Quraysh's army stood behind the hill on the further side and that the leaders of Quraysh were all present.\nThe next day news reached them that the caravan had in fact passed them by on a different route and that Quraysh's army were still in the vicinity close by. With this news, whatever hopes for booty some of them may have entertained collapsed. The Prophet discussed with his companions whether or not they should now return to Madinah and not force a showdown with Quraysh's army. In  connection with this, the following verses of the Quran were revealed: \"And remember when Allah promised you one of the two parties (of the enemy i.e. either the army or the caravan) that it should be yours, you wished that the one not armed (the caravan) should be yours, but Allah willed to justify the truth by His Words and to cut off the roots of the disbelievers.\"\nQuraysh asked themselves the same question. However, Abu Jahl insisted that the fight should go ahead so that Muhammad ﷺ can be routed and destroyed. There was some hesitation in the camp of Quraysh with one tribe returning to Makkah, but the rest followed Abu Jahl and set up camp behind a sand dune. The Muslims hurried to the springs of Badr. When they reached the first water well, Muhammad ﷺ dismounted with the intention of camping there. Recognising the area, Al Hubab ibn al Mundhir approached the Prophet and suggested that the Muslims reach the well closest to the enemy. There they would bring a trough to it, to fill with water and then fill the well with sand. Thus in the engagement the Muslims would fight the enemy having possession of all of the water. The Prophet immediately agreed and rose to go forward with his force.\nOn realising that the Muslims were moving into position, Quraysh arranged and readied themselves for battle. A shower of rain hardened the ground and made it easier for the Muslims to move but more difficult for the Makkans, who had to toil uphill. Some of the men of Quraysh, although acknowledging that the Muslims numbered a mere 300, feared for the heads of Quraysh as they had all joined the battle. ‘Utbah bin Rabi'ah advised his peers to return to their homes and leave Muhammad ﷺ alone amongst the tribes. But when Abu Jahl heard these words of ‘Utbah, he raged in anger, inciting Quraysh to drive towards the Muslims.\nAs always in Arabia, the battle of Badr began with single combats. Al Aswad sprang out of the ranks of  Quraysh toward the Muslims seeking to destroy the trough and drink from the well of Badr but Hamzah (RA) stood ready striking him with his sword, cutting off his legs and killing him.\nAs soon as Al Aswad fell, other members of Quraysh sprang forth challenging the Muslims to duel wanting to fight their own tribesmen. At this, Hamzah (RA), ‘Ali (RA), and 'Ubaydah ibn al Harith (RA) advanced forth and slew their opponents. No sooner had they charged were all three men of Quraysh lying dead on the ground. 'Ubaydah (RA) received a lethal blow to his leg, severing it. As the marrow oozed from it's stump he had only one thought. \"Am I not a martyr, O Messenger of Allah?\" he said as the Prophet came to his aid. \"Indeed you are,\" he answered. When the Quraishite army saw this, they advanced and the two armies collided.\nThe Prophet prayed to his Lord ceaselessly and persistently to come to their help and when the engagement grew fierce he again began to supplicate his Lord saying, \"O Allah! Should this group of Muslims be defeated today, You will no longer be worshipped.\"\nWhen the believers were ordered to charge, they did not charge alone, for the Prophet had been promised through the Quran: \"When you sought aid from your Lord, so He answered you: I will assist you with a thousand of the angels following one another.\" The presence of the Angels was felt by all, but that presence was only visible or audible to a few, and in varying degrees.\nDuring the course of battle, Bilal (RA) killed Umayyah ibn Khalaf, his previous master who would torture him by placing a large rock on his chest and letting him burn under the scorching sun in order to force him to renounce Islam.  Mu'adh ibn 'Amr (RA) killed Abu Jahl. Hamzah (RA), Ali (RA) and other Muslim heroes penetrated deeply into enemy lines, forgetting themselves, their small numbers, and their being surrounded by the enemies. Muslims hurled themselves into the encounter chanting, \"Allah is one! Allah is one!\" By midday Quraysh, who had expected to have to make a show of force, panicked and fled in disarray, leaving about fifty of their leading men, including Abu Jahl himself, dead on the field. When the dust begun the settle and the unbelievers had fled the battle field, the Muslims collected the dead of  Quraysh and buried them on the spot. The Prophet and his companions spent that night on the battlefield burying their dead, collecting the booty and keeping watch of the captives. The outcome of the battle was a humiliating defeat for the polytheists. They sustained heavy casualties, seventy were killed and a like number taken prisoners. Many of the principal men of Makkah, and some of the Prophet's bitterest opponents were among the slain.\nFourteen Muslims were killed, of who six were from the Emigrants, Muhajirun, and eight from the Helpers, Al Ansar.\nThe question as to what to do with the captives troubled the Prophet  and he submitted the matter to the Muslims and sought their advice. Abu Bakr (RA) appealed to The Prophet's  gentleness and stirred his compassion. He pleaded,\n\"O Prophet of Allah ﷺ, you are dearer than my father and my mother. Your captives consist of men who are parents, sons, cousins, uncles and brothers of your own people. The most removed of them is still a member of your clan and a blood relative. Be good to them and forgive them. Allah will forgive you and be good to you. Otherwise allow them to be ransomed and take from them that which would increase the Muslims in power. Perhaps, by such action, Allah will soften their hearts toward Islam.\"\nUmar (RA), coming after Abu Bakr (RA), sat in his place and pleaded: \"O Prophet of Allah ﷺ, these are the enemies of Allah. They have belied you, fought you, and banished you. Strike their necks. They are the leaders of idolatry and misguidance. By this course Allah will consolidate Islam and bring low the idolaters.\" The Prophet then decided to ransom the captives, to which Allah revealed,\n\"It does not behove a Prophet to hold captives; nor to tyrannise in the world. You seek the advantages of this world whereas Allah wishes you to seek the advantages of the other. Allah is almighty and all-wise.\"",
       "Stage_summary": "During this period of Prophet Muhammad's ﷺ life, the Muslims, having undertaken the Hijra, faced the challenge of sustaining themselves through raids (ghazus) due to economic hardships. Prophet Muhammad ﷺ dispatched raiding parties to intercept Makkah's caravans, conveying a clear message of defiance.\n\nThe Battle of Badr unfolded when the Muslims, anticipating a caravan, found themselves facing a well-prepared Makkan army led by Abu Jahl. Despite initial uncertainty among the Muslims about engaging in a pitched battle, they ultimately decided to face Quraysh.\n\nThe Ansar and Emigrants expressed unwavering support for the Prophet ﷺ, with Sa'd ibn Mu'adh pledging absolute allegiance. The Prophet's ﷺ face radiated joy, and the Muslims advanced with hope, trusting in Allah's promise of victory.\n\nThe battle began with single combats, and despite being outnumbered, the Muslims, including Hamzah, Ali, and Ubaydah, displayed remarkable valor. The presence of angels, though unseen by many, aided the Muslims. The Quraysh suffered a humiliating defeat, with their leaders, including Abu Jahl, among the casualties.\n\nAfter the battle, the question of dealing with captives arose. Abu Bakr advocated forgiveness and mercy, emphasizing familial ties, while Umar urged strict punishment. The Prophet ﷺ chose to ransom the captives, and Allah revealed guidance on the humane treatment of prisoners.\n\nThe Battle of Badr marked a turning point, solidifying the Muslims' faith and establishing their credibility.

But the Prophet still desired that the Quraysh be guided and eventually enter into the fold of Islam.\nIt was now nearing the anniversary of Badr and in the last days of Ramadan the Prophet received a sealed letter from a horseman who had ridden from Makkah to Madinah in three days. It was from his uncle 'Abbas (RA), warning him that an army of three thousand men was on the point of marching out towards Madinah.\n By the time the letter had arrived the Quraysh had already set out. Abu Sufyan (RA), the commander-in-chief, took with him his wife Hind and also a second wife, as did other notables. They also brought along an expert at throwing javelin, Wahshi, the Abyssinian slave who had seldom been known to miss his mark. His mission was to assassinate Hamza (RA).\nQuraysh and their allies began their march against Muhammad ﷺ equipped with great amounts of armour, two hundred horses, and three thousand camels. The Emigrants and Helpers were extremely apprehensive, and the next morning the Prophet called a counsel of war. Through mutual consultation it became evident that the majority were not in favour of fighting from within the city walls, and so the Prophet decided to attack. At noon they assembled for the Friday prayer, and the theme of his sermon was Jihad and all that it demands of earnestness and effort; thereafter he said that victory would be theirs if they remained steadfast and commanded them to make preparations for war; in the name of Allah.\nThe Prophet set out with his army in the direction of Uhud in search of an advantage point for his army and when they were half-way the sun began to set. The Prophet gave instructions that the army should be ready to move off shortly before dawn. But, ‘Abdullah ibn Ubayy, had been in consultation with some of his nearest followers during the night, and when it was time to raise camp he turned back to Madinah with three hundred of the hypocrites and doubters without even speaking to the Prophet. Reduced now to seven hundred against the three thousand Makkan fighters the believers marched on.\nWhen the Muslim force reached Uhud the Prophet ordered his companions in rows and placed fifty of his best archers on the side of the mountain, in case of a surprise attack from the rear. He explicitly ordered the archers to protect that side under all circumstances and never to leave it until he commanded them otherwise. Thus the two parties were poised for battle. Hamzah (RA) gave the war cry, \"Die! Die!\" and charged into the ranks of the Quraysh. Ali (RA) engaged Talhah (RA), carrier of the Makkan flag, and killed him with a single stroke. The Prophet's archers shot a volley of arrows into Khalid ibn Walid (RA)'s cavalry.\nQuraysh's forces advanced fiercely and the disproportionately numbered sides began their engagement. Hamzah (RA), who was unmistakable for his unusually powerful stature was recognised by Wahshi, who had found him out. He threw his javelin aiming for a tiny chink in his armour and fatally pierced Hamza (RA)'s abdomen. The great warrior staggered a few paces forward and fell to the ground in the throes of death.\nBut the Muslims continued in valour, and upon killing all the flag bearers who rose to hold the banner of the allies, the enemy realised defeat was imminent and began to flee. However, defeat is followed by booty and the archers whom the Prophet had commanded to remain behind on the hill now sought to join their comrades and gain their share. Abdullah ibn Jubayr (RA) appealed to them to remain on the hill but they descended to the plain with only ten men keeping their ground. This provided Khalid (RA), commander of the Makkan cavalry, the prime opportunity to attack and seize the mountainside where the archers were. By doing so, he managed to flank the believers and take them by surprise. After he occupied the mountainside, Khalid (RA) signalled to Quraysh to attack again as he advanced upon the Muslims from the rear. The defeated Makkans rallied to his call, and the Muslims soon found themselves in trouble; disunited on the battle field. With the believers being attacked from every direction, all sense of strategy started to crumble, and with the cry that Muhammad ﷺ was killed, chaos reigned supreme and the Muslims began to flee.\nHowever, those with steadfast faith stood close to the Prophet drawing a close circle around him for his protection. The Prophet had been hit with a stone thrown by Utbah ibn Abu Waqqas which caused him to fall to the ground with a wounded face and a broken tooth.  It's sheer force pushed two links of the Prophet's helmet into his wound and Abu Ubaydah (RA) broke his own front teeth trying to force the links out of the Prophet's cheek. He and his companions then began to retreat toward the mountain of Uhud while fighting their pursuing enemies.\nBoth sides regrouped and a stalemate began to form. Before his army moved off, Abu Sufyan (RA) heard the disappointing news that Muhammad ﷺ had not been killed after all. The struggle with Madinah was not over. 'Next year at Badr!' he cried, as a final challenge, and on behalf of Muhammad ﷺ one the companions cried-'Yes, it is an appointment between us!'",
       "Stage_summary": "\nIn the second year after the Hijrah, the Prophet (peace be upon him) and his companions faced a much larger and better equipped army from Makkah at the Battle of Uhud. The Prophet (peace be upon him) deployed his forces strategically on the slopes of Mount Uhud, with archers stationed on the mountainside to protect them from rear attacks. The battle began with the Muslims gaining the upper hand, but the archers disobeyed the Prophet's (peace be upon him) orders and left their positions to pursue the fleeing Makkans. This allowed Khalid ibn Walid to flank the Muslims and attack from the rear. The Muslims were caught off guard and began to retreat, with many believing that the Prophet (peace be upon him) had been killed.\n\nHowever, a few steadfast companions remained with the Prophet (peace be upon him) and fought to protect him. The Prophet (peace be upon him) himself was wounded by a stone thrown by Utbah ibn Abu Waqqas, but he continued to fight until the battle came to an end. The Muslims eventually retreated to the safety of Mount Uhud, but they had suffered heavy casualties, including the death of Hamza (may Allah be pleased with him), the Prophet's (peace be upon him) beloved uncle.\n\nDespite the defeat at Uhud, the Muslims did not give up hope. They learned from their mistakes and prepared for the next battle. The Prophet (peace be upon him) also continued to spread the message of Islam, and his community continued to grow."

       "Combined_Content": "The Battle of Uhud enabled the non-Muslim elements of Madinah and its surroundings to become emboldened in their attitude towards the Muslims. Then came news that the Bani Asad, a powerful tribe from Najd, were planning a raid on Madinah. Thus, the Prophet  took care to remain abreast of any such developments and to demonstrate to the rest of Arabia that the Muslims derived strength from Uhud rather than weakness.\nThe Prophet swiftly dispatched a force of a hundred at fifty well armed warriors into their northern territory under the command of Abu Salamah (RA) with instructions to do all in his power to take the camp of Banu Asad by surprise. Abu Salamah (RA) found his enemy unprepared and shortly before dawn, he inspired his men to holy war, and they attacked. The Bedouin army quickly withdrew and scattered in all directions while the Muslims collected the booty returning to Madinah victorious.\nAbout the same time news came of the danger of another projected raid from further south; but in this instance the Prophet judged that all the hostility was concentrated in one remarkably evil man, Khalid ibn Sufyan, the chief of the Lihyanite branch of Hudhayl. If they could rid themselves of him, the danger from that quarter would become negligible. He commanded Abdullah ibn Unais (RA) to seek out this man, describing to him some of his features. In the course of his mission, he unexpectedly found Khalid relaxing in the company of women. Having managed to separate Khalid from his men, on the pretext of joining his ranks, Abdullah (RA) swiftly assassinated him. This solitary campaign had the great effect of silencing the Banu Lihyan branch of the Hudhayl tribe.\nAll idea of the projected raid against Madinah was now abandoned, but it was no doubt in revenge for this death of one of their chiefs that in the following month some men of Hudhayl attacked six Muslims who were on their way to give religious instruction to two of the smaller neighbouring tribes. The encounter took place in Raji', a watering place not far from Makkah. Three of the Prophet's men died fighting, and three were taken captive, one of whom was subsequently killed when he tried to escape.\nThe first captive was Khubaib (RA) about whom it was unanimously decided to crucify him. Before his execution, he requested he be allowed some time in which he offered two units of prayer. Upon completion, he turned to his executioners and informed them that he would have prayed longer were it not that they would assume he was afraid of death. Abu Sufyan (RA) then asked him whether he wished Muhammad ﷺ were here in his place, to which Khubaib (RA) answered that he would not even want a thorn to prick the Prophet that he might thereby be sitting with his family. Surprised with his response, the Quraysh ordered 'Uqbah bin Al-Harith, whose father had been killed by Khubaib (RA) himself, to crucify him. During the ordeal Khubaib (RA) called upon Allah saying, \"O Allah! Count them one by one, and exterminate them to the last one.\"\nThe second captive was Zayd (RA) and was purchased by Safwan ibn Umayyah in order to be killed in revenge for his father, Umayyah ibn Khalaf.\nLater this year the Prophet married Zainab (RA), daughter of Khuzaymah of the Bedouin tribe of 'Amir. A fourth apartment was made for her in his house adjoining the Mosque, and it was doubtless in connection with this new alliance that the Prophet now received a visit from Abu Bara, the ageing chief of Zaynab's (RA) tribe. He appealed to him to accept Islam and though he did not convert, he was inclined to the message reaching his people.  Inevitably, the Prophet remained weary given what had just happened at Raji' and therefore rejected Abu Bara's request. Abu Bara replied stating that he would personally be their guardian and protector as chief of 'Amir. Given his notable influence the Prophet chose forty from the foremost Muslim ranks, placing in command of them a man from Khazraj, Mundhir ibn 'Amr .\nIt was not known in Madinah that Abu Bara's leadership was disputed within the tribe, and his nephew, who aspired to be chief in his place, killed one of the Companions who had been sent ahead with a letter from the Prophet, and called upon his tribe to slaughter the others. His tribesmen refused to violate the protection already extended by Abu Bara, and so Amir summoned other tribes who had been in recent hostilities with the Muslims. They immediately sent out a detachment of horse and massacred the whole delegation of unsuspecting Muslims in their camp by the well of Ma'unah, except for two men who had been away to pasture the camels. They were dismayed to see vultures in great numbers circling low above their camp and found their Companions laying  dead in their own blood.\nThe fall of the Muslim martyrs at the well of Ma'unah deeply grieved the Prophet. His blaming Abu Bara' incensed the latter given that he had given his word. So Abu Bara, for his part, was extremely wrathful against Amir ibn Tufayl for violating his protective covenant with the Muslims and sent his own son, al Raji', to kill Amir in vengeance for the violated honour.\nThis persisting culture of treachery also afflicted the Jews of Banu al Nadir. The Prophet on seeking their assistance in the payment of blood-libel (in accordance with the clauses of the treaty that both parties had already signed), went to them near Quba along with ten of his prominent companions. The Jews, on their part, pretended to comply with the Prophet's requirement, although their true intention was to assassinate the Prophet by dropping a large millstone on his head. However, the Prophet was informed of their iniquitous plot by Gabriel and he, along with his Companions, returned back to Madinah.\nThe Prophet admonished the Jews of Banu al Nadir and commanded them to leave Madinah. They were given ten days to evacuate after which any Jew seen in Madinah would be killed. However, no Jew left the city, and instead they readied for a siege believing that they could easy outlive it. So the Muslims took up arms and began to fight the Jews. For twenty days and nights the hostilities ensued and in realising that they were overcome, the Jews requested the Prophet to guarantee their lives and properties and to give them safe passage out of Madinah. The Prophet mercifully complied and the Jews left for Tabuk.",
       "Stage_summary": "During this period of Prophet Muhammad's ﷺ life:\n\nPost-Battle of Uhud: The Battle of Uhud brought increased hostility from non-Muslims in Madinah. To counter potential threats, the Prophet ﷺ dispatched a force to surprise the Bani Asad, achieving victory.\n\nElimination of Khalid ibn Sufyan: Recognizing the danger from the Lihyanite tribe, the Prophet ﷺ ordered the assassination of their chief, Khalid ibn Sufyan, executed by Abdullah ibn Unais, thereby neutralizing the threat.\n\nHudhayl Attack: In retaliation for Khalid's death, men of Hudhayl attacked and killed three Muslims, with Khubaib (RA) being captured. Khubaib bravely faced execution with a prayer and firmness in faith.\n\nZayd's Fate: Another captive, Zayd (RA), was purchased and killed in revenge for his father. These events showcased the challenges faced by early Muslims.\n\nMarriage to Zainab (RA): The Prophet ﷺ married Zainab, daughter of Khuzaymah, strengthening ties with the Bedouin tribe of 'Amir.\n\nRaji Tragedy: A delegation sent to Amir was ambushed and massacred at Raji, causing grief to the Prophet ﷺ. Tensions arose between Abu Bara and Amir, leading to a series of revenge killings.\n\nBanu al Nadir Betrayal: The Jews of Banu al Nadir plotted against the Prophet's ﷺ life. Informed by Gabriel, the Prophet ﷺ returned, admonished the Jews of Banu al Nadir, and eventually expelled them from Madinah after a failed siege.\n\nMercy in Victory: Despite hostilities, the Prophet ﷺ showed mercy, granting safe passage to the expelled Jews of Banu al Nadir as they left for Tabuk.\n\nThroughout, the Prophet's ﷺ actions reflected strategic foresight, mercy, and steadfastness in the face of challenges, maintaining the spiritual touch and reverence associated with his prophethood."

       "Combined_Content": "The exiled Jews of Banu Nadir who had settled in Khaybar were determined to recover the land they had lost. Their hopes were centred on the preparations of  Quraysh for a final attack on the Prophet; and towards the end of the fifth year of Islam these preparations were brought to a head by the secret visit to Makkah of Huyay and other Jewish leaders from Khaybar. Upon realising the intent behind the visit Abu Sufyan and other notables invited the Jews inside the Ka'bah, and together they swore a solemn oath to God that they would not fail one another until they had achieved their goal.\nIn 627, a massive army of ten thousand men-of Quraysh and their confederates-were on the March towards Madinah. Upon reaching its outskirts, they encamped. Word had reached the Prophet almost a week before the arrival and adopted a stratagem suggested to him by Salman Al-Farsi, a Persian companion. The Prophet mobilised the entire community to dig a huge trench around the most vulnerable parts of the city. Time was short and all efforts would have to be strained to the utmost if no dangerous gap were to be left in the defences. The Prophet worked alongside them, sometimes with a pickaxe, sometimes with a shovel and sometimes as a carrier. With tremendous effort, the whole trench was dug in six days.\nThe Prophet amassed three thousand Muslims on the side of Sal' mountain in Madinah with only the trench separating the believers from the enemies.\nWhen the Quraysh arrived with their army, they stared blankly at the trench; they were bewildered. The earth from the ditch had been used to build a high escarpment, which effectively shielded the Madinese in their camp. Khalid (RA) and Ikrimah (RA) examined the trench, albeit from a distance, to see where it might easily be crossed. \"This is a piece of trickery!\" they exclaimed in exasperation. Given the impossibility of crossing the trench, both sides maintained a simple exchange of javelins for a number of days.\nThe siege lasted only a month, but it seemed endless. Feeding and supplying the allies of Madinah as well as their own people, put a great strain on the city's resources. The trench had to be manned day and night, so that each man would have to keep watch for long hours. On one occasion the time for noon prayer came and went without it being performed even by the Prophet. It was only when the last light had faded from the west that they moved back to their camps.\nAbdullah Ibn Ubayy and his party of hypocrites, accused Muhammad ﷺ  of bringing ruin upon them, and the Jewish tribe of Madinah, Banu Qurayzah, openly began to support Quraysh, breaking their treaty with the Prophet and openly began to announce their renunciation of the pact. They now felt that the siege was too strong and the Quraysh would soon be victorious. Some of the companions adjured them to revert back to the treaty before it was too late, but they only answered: \"Who is the Messenger of Allah? There is no pact between us and Muhammad ﷺ not any agreement.\"\nThroughout the Battle of the Trench, as the siege became known, the Muslims were terrified. Faced with the prospect of extermination, some came close to despair. But even as those inside the city trembled, on the outside of the ditch,  Quraysh were becoming exhausted. Their resolve began to waiver and finally snapped when a violent rainstorm devastated their camp. Abu Sufyan recognised defeat. Horses and camels were dying, the Qurayzah had failed to deliver any real help. \"Be off,\" he announced to his men, \"for I am going.\" When the Muslims peered over the escarpment the next morning, the plain was completely deserted.",
       "Stage_summary": "During this period of Prophet Muhammad's (pbuh) life, the exiled Jews of Banu Nadir in Khaybar sought to regain lost land and allied with Quraysh for an attack. In 627, a formidable army of ten thousand, including Quraysh and allies, marched towards Madinah. In response, the Prophet ﷺ, guided by Salman Al-Farsi, had a trench dug around vulnerable parts of the city in a week. The Prophet ﷺ, alongside the community, actively participated in the laborious task.\n\nThe Muslims, numbering three thousand, faced the enemy across the trench. The Quraysh, bewildered by the unexpected obstacle, engaged in a standoff with the Muslims. The siege lasted a month, causing strain on resources and creating a tense atmosphere. The hypocrites, led by Abdullah Ibn Ubayy, accused the Prophet ﷺ, and the Jewish tribe Banu Qurayzah betrayed their pact with the Prophet ﷺ to support Quraysh.\n\nDespite internal fears, the Muslims stood resilient. Quraysh's resolve weakened, and a violent rainstorm devastated their camp. Abu Sufyan acknowledged defeat, leading to their retreat. The Muslims, peering over the escarpment the next morning, found the plain deserted. This event, known as the Battle of the Trench, showcased the Prophet's ﷺ strategic acumen and the community's steadfastness, ultimately leading to the retreat of the Quraysh and their allies."

       "Combined_Content": "Muhammad ﷺ's success over Quraysh at the Battle of the Trench was an impressive victory.  Five years earlier, he had arrived in the oasis as a weary, travel-worn migrant who had been hounded by the people of Makkah. Now he had reversed that state of affairs, proving before the whole of Arabia that his resolve, by the help of Allah, was neither weak nor indecisive.\nOne night towards the end of Ramadan the Prophet dreamed that with his head shaved, he entered the Holy Sanctuary of Makkah, unarmed, in a state of peace. As soon as the Muslims were told of this, they praised Allah and hastened to make preparations and gathered together seventy camels, which had to be sacrificed in the sacred precinct.\nThe Prophet had his clothes washed, mounted his camel and marched towards Makkah at the head of fifteen hundred Muslims. They carried no weapons with them except sheathed swords because they had no intention of fighting. As they approached Dhul Hulaifah, everybody donned the age-old traditional pilgrim's dress of two pieces of unstitched cloth, one tied around the waist, and the other draped round the shoulders. The Prophet then uttered the ancient cry of the pilgrims as they approached the Ka'bah, Labbayk Allahumma Labayk! Which means 'Here I am, O Allah, at your service!'\nKhalid ibn Al Walid (RA) was sent with a troop of 200 cavalry to prevent the Muslims from entering the city and when the pilgrims had reached the well of Usfan, their scout brought them news the Khalid (RA) was only eight miles away. However, the Prophet after having received this intelligence, re-routed bringing them to the locality of Hudaybiyah; by-passing Khalid (RA) and his men. For his part, Khalid (RA) returned to Makkah to inform the leaders of the latest developments.\nQuraysh sent Budayl ibn Warqa' (RA) together with some tribesmen from Khuza'ah to the Muslim camp to dissuade Muhammad ﷺ from executing his plan. However, they became convinced that the Prophet did not come to fight but to honour the sanctuary. The delegation returned advising that the Muslims be permitted to fulfil their pilgrimage but Quraysh remained unconvinced. They sent Urwah ibn Mas'ud (RA) who also concluded as Budayl did, and with negotiations between the Prophet and  Quraysh lasting a long time, the Muslims were beginning to become agitated.\nThe Prophet called upon Uthman ibn Affan (RA) and sent him to Abu Sufyan (RA) and the noblemen of Quraysh. The negotiations were lengthy during which Uthman (RA) was forced to stay in Makkah. Soon, the Muslims began to suspect that he had been treacherously killed. With tension rising in the Muslim camp, and everybody reaching for their swords, the Prophet assured them that he would not allow them to return without challenging their enemies. He called his companions to gather under a large acacia tree in the middle of the valley, and there they covenanted with him to fight to the last man. This covenant would later become known as the Bay'ah al Ridwan, the Pledge of Good Pleasure.\nHowever, before long, news reached the Muslims that Uthman (RA) had not been murdered and he would soon be returned safe and sound. Upon his return he conveyed to the Prophet the message of Quraysh in that they believed that the Muslims had come merely for the purpose of pilgrimage, but at the same time, they could not let them enter Makkah as other tribes would conclude that Quraysh had been defeated. Thus they began a new round of negotiations whereby  Quraysh sent Suhayl ibn Amr to reconcile with the Prophet to return for the same purpose the following year wherein the Quraishites would leave Makkah for three days, allowing the Muslims to perform the pilgrimage.\nIn the Muslim camp the believers listened in on these negotiations and often became severely angered at the obstinacy with which Suhayl refused to make any concessions, and the leniency with which the Prophet made his. A peace treaty was agreed upon, which was to last for ten years. Any person from Quraysh emigrating to Muhammad ﷺ's camp without permission from his guardian would have to be returned to Makkah, whereas any Muslim emigrating from Muhammad ﷺ's camp to Makkah would not have to be returned. It also specified that any tribe was free to ally itself to Muhammad ﷺ without incurring any guilt or censure from  Quraysh, and likewise, any tribe seeking an alliance with Quraysh could do so without let or hindrance from the Muslims. The pact stipulated that Muhammad ﷺ and his companions would leave the area of Makkah that year without fulfilling their religious function but that they might return the next year. When the believers saw the negotiations for peace and a withdrawal going on and what the Prophet had taken on himself they felt saddened  and defeated. Umar (RA) despaired and complained to Abu Bakr (RA), 'Why should we agree to what is demeaning to our religion?' Abu Bakr (RA), though shaken himself, told Umar (RA) to have faith in Muhammad ﷺ, for he could see further than anybody else at Hudaybiyah; even though the pilgrimage had not turned out as they expected, it had been an inspiration that had put them on the road to peace.",
       "Stage_summary": "During this period of Prophet Muhammad's (pbuh) life, marked by the Battle of the Trench and the events surrounding the Treaty of Hudaybiyah, he ﷺ demonstrated remarkable success and resolve. The Battle of the Trench showcased his ﷺ strategic acumen, turning the tide from his earlier struggles in Makkah.\n\nA significant moment occurred when the Prophet ﷺ received a divine dream, envisioning a peaceful pilgrimage to Makkah. In response, he ﷺ led a non-militarized pilgrimage towards the Holy Sanctuary. Despite initial tensions, negotiations ensued. Khalid ibn Al Walid's (RA) presence raised concerns, but the Prophet ﷺ skillfully redirected the route to avoid confrontation.\n\nDiplomatic efforts continued, with Quraysh initially sending delegates to dissuade the Prophet ﷺ. Despite initial resistance, the Muslims, under the Prophet's ﷺ leadership, remained committed to their peaceful pilgrimage. The situation escalated when it was falsely believed that Uthman (RA) had been killed, leading to the Bay'ah al Ridwan, a pledge of unwavering commitment to the Prophet.\n\nUpon Uthman's safe return, further negotiations took place. The Treaty of Hudaybiyah, a ten-year peace pact, was agreed upon. Some terms appeared unfavorable to the Muslims, causing frustration among them, notably Umar (RA). However, Abu Bakr (RA) urged trust in the Prophet's ﷺ vision, emphasizing that the seemingly challenging agreement paved the way for future peace.\n\nDespite the disappointment of not performing the pilgrimage that year, the events at Hudaybiyah set the stage for a broader understanding. The Prophet's ﷺ wisdom and foresight ultimately guided the Muslims towards a period of peace and laid the foundation for the eventual conquest of Makkah."

       "Combined_Content": "Shortly after Hudaybiyah, the Prophet sent a message to Abysinnia, inviting the Muslims there to join him in Madinah to help with the struggle. Then he turned his attention to the north again. The Jewish settlement of Khaybar, which had played such a divisive role during the siege of Madinah, had been chastened by the fate of Banu Qurayzah but it was still stirring up hostility among the northern tribes. Muhammad ﷺ wanted to make sure that they would never threaten the security of the Muslim community again, so not long after his return from Hudaybiyah he set off with a force of around fifteen-hundred men.\nThe believers were certain that that the near victory promised in the recent revelation- a victory which would moreover be rich in spoils- could be nothing other than the conquest of Khaybar. But this was not to be shared with all those who professed Islam. The revelation made it clear that those bedouin who had failed to respond to his summons to make the lesser pilgrimage had been largely prompted by mercenary motives. They were therefore not to be allowed to take part in the conquest of what was, without doubt, one of the richest communities in all Arabia.\nThis meant setting off with a smaller force, though it had the advantage that their plans could be kept secret until the last moment. When Quraysh heard of the news, they were jubilant, certain that the Muslims would be defeated. Surrounded, like Madinah, with plains of volcanic rock and defended by seven large fortresses, Khaybar was thought to be impregnable. The Prophet and his men reached Khaybar in three days with the Jews caught extremely by surprise. The Jews sent for help from the tribe of Ghatafan but the Muslim army prevented any such assistance from reaching Khaybar. Moreover, they were able to benefit from the internal strife within the Khabarite ranks as each tribe was autonomous and they found it difficult to unite against a common enemy.\nThe siege lasted a month with the Muslims systematically surrounding each fort in turn, bombarding it with arrows until it surrendered. And so each fort fell one after the other. Eventually the Jews approached Muhammad ﷺ with an offer of peace when it was quite clear that they could not possibly win. The Prophet mercifully accepted their plea and permitted them to stay on their land whose title now passed to him by right of conquest. The terms of their surrender were that Muhammad ﷺ would give the Jews of Khaybar military protection in return for half their date-crop. Thus, all the Jews of the Peninsula submitted to the authority of the Holy Prophet and the northern flank of Muslim power, namely the whole area north of Madinah, was now as secure as the south had become through the treaty of Hudaybiyah. When they returned to Madinah, the believers from Abyssinia had arrived and Muhammad ﷺ embraced his cousin Ja'far, whom he had last seen as a young man of twenty-seven thirteen years earlier. He kissed him on the forehead, saying that he did not know which delighted him more, the victory of Khaybar or this reunion.",

With a force of around fifteen hundred men, the Prophet ﷺ aimed to ensure Khaybar would no longer be a source of hostility. The believers believed a recent revelation promised near victory in the conquest of Khaybar.\n\nTo maintain secrecy, the Prophet ﷺ set off with a smaller force. Despite Quraysh's jubilation at the news, the Muslim army reached Khaybar in three days, catching the Jews by surprise.

After a month, all the forts surrendered, and the Jews offered peace. The Prophet ﷺ, displaying mercy, accepted their plea, allowing them to stay on the land under his military protection in exchange for half their date-crop.\n\nThis conquest secured the northern flank of Muslim power, making the entire area north of Madinah as secure as the south under the Hudaybiyah treaty. Upon returning to Madinah, the believers from Abyssinia had arrived. The Prophet ﷺ joyfully embraced his cousin Jafar, whom he had last seen thirteen years earlier.

       "Combined_Content": "# The conquest of Makkah - 629 CE (8 AH):\nIn November 629, the situation in Arabia changed dramatically: the Quraysh broke the Treaty of Hudaybiyah. Aided and abetted by some Quraysh, the tribe of Bakr, one of their bedouin allies, made a surprise attack on the tribe of Khuza'ah, which had joined Muhammad ﷺ's confederacy. Khuza'ah promptly asked Muhammad ﷺ for help and the Quraysh woke up to the fact that they had given Muhammad ﷺ a perfect excuse to attack Makkah. In the meantime they became exceedingly troubled as to the possible consequences of what had happened, and so they sent Abu Sufyan (RA) to pacify the Prophet. The Prophet parried his request and maintained that he was in no way interested in making any new deal with the Makkans. After his departure, Muhammad ﷺ began to plan a new campaign.\nOn the 10th of Ramadan, Muhammad ﷺ set out at the head of the largest force ever to leave Madinah. Nearly all the men in the Muslim lands had volunteered to be part of the army and along the road their bedouin allies joined forces with the Muslims. However, only the closest of the disciples were informed of the plan to conquer Makkah as the Prophet wanted to keep the mission a secret for as long as possible.\nIn Makkah, the Quraishite leaders feared the worst. Abbas (RA), Abu Sufyan (RA), and Budayl (RA), chief of Khuza'ah, all made their way under the cover of night to the Muslim camp. They were escorted to Muhammad ﷺ who received them and prompted Abu Sufyan (RA) and Budayl (RA) to accept Islam. After some hesitation the two submitted and testified \"\"There is no deity worthy of worship except Allah and Muhammad ﷺ is His messenger\"\".  The conversion of Abu Sufyan (RA) did not inhibit the Prophet from his plan rather he ordered that Abu Sufyan (RA) be held at the gate of the valley in the outskirts of Makkah. The Prophet advanced with the army until he reached Dhu Tuwa with the city in sight. He stopped his forces and busied himself in prayer, supplication, and praising the Most High and and beseeching Him for victory.\nThe army was divided into four groups and they were commanded not to engage in any fighting or bloodshed except in critical situations. The armies entered and occupied the city without opposition, with the little resistance being dealt with by Khalid ibn al Walid (RA).\nThe Prophet mounted his she camel, al Qaswa, and rode down towards the Ka'bah with his head lowered in humility to Allah. Upon reaching the Ka'bah he endeavoured, in full view of the Quraysh, to smash the idols scattered around it while he recited the Quranic verse:\nThe truth has come, and falsehood has vanished away; surely falsehood is certain to vanish\nHe  then circumambulated the sacred house on his camel and then alighted and called upon Uthman bin Talhah (RA) to open the Ka'bah for him. Inside he found pictures of Ibrahim (AS) and Ismael (AS) holding divination arrows which he promptly destroyed. Upon exiting the Ka'bah he stood at the door surrounded by his people and granted a general amnesty to all the people of Quraysh and Makkans, save ten people who were put on a black list. After his speech beside the Ka'bah, Muhammad ﷺ withdrew to Mount Safa and invited the people of Makkah to swear fealty. One by one, the Quraysh filed up to the Prophet, who sat flanked by 'Umar (RA) and Abu Bakr (RA), and gave their pledges of allegiance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Campaign of Tabuk - 630 CE (9 AH):\nA short while after the conquest of Makkah growing rumours began to spread in Madinah that Heraclius had advanced a year's salary to his army in view of a lengthy campaign against Madinah. However, the Prophet was also expecting his armies to open up Syria to Islam and so he too set about mustering by far the largest and best equipped army which he had led.\nThis time there was no attempt at secrecy with Muhammad ﷺ ordering even the Makkans and the allied tribes to send at once to Madinah all their available armed and mounted men for the Syrian campaign.\nThe season was always a hot one, but that year there was a drought and the heat was more oppressive than usual. These were testing times for the believers with many of the hypocrites approaching the Prophet with various excuses to stay behind. There were however three men of good faith, Ka'b ibn Malik (RA) and two other, who did not deliberately decide to remain home, nor did they proffer excuses; but it seemed to them so undesirable to leave Madinah with the rest of the army that they put off preparations until the last minute when it dawned on them that it was too late.\nThe army arrived at al Hijr where the rock-hewn remains of Thamud stood, and the Prophet commanded the army to dismount for watering and a brief rest. Then, when the army reached the spring of Tabuk they encamped for twenty days. It was evident that the rumours of danger from the Byzantines had been unfounded; perhaps the news of the Muslim army's approach had already reached the Byzantines who had withdrawn to the safety of their vicinity. The Prophet chose not to pursue the Byzantines, but instead invited all of the tribes to join in allegiance to the Muslims.\nBefore the Muslim army was to return, the Prophet intended to put to a stop any future attack, and so, he sent Khalid ibn al Walid (RA) with five hundred cavalrymen to deal with Ukaydir, the Christian king of Dumah who was suspected of preparing to launch an attack as soon as the Byzantine forces could return. The rest of the army was commanded to return to Madinah.\nKhalid (RA) hurried to Dumah and, discovering that the king was out on a hunting trip with his brother, sought to attack them decisively, and killed Hassan, the king's brother, while capturing Ukaydir. However, Khalid (RA) was unable to penetrate the city, but by threatening to kill Ukaydir the city yielded. After seizing two thousand camels, eight hundred goats, four hundred loads of grain, and four hundred coats of arms, Khalid brought them, together with his captive, King Ukaydir, to Madinah. In Madinah Ukaydir was offered Islam to which he converted. Upon his submission to Allah, he was reinstated as the king of his people and an ally of the Prophet. Upon the army's return, those who failed to enlist came forth to offer their excuses. Many a Hypocrite presented his excuse; the Prophet listened and let them go free pending Allah's final judgment. However, there were three believers who truthfully stated their reasons; Ka'b ibn Malik (RA), Murarah (RA), and Hilal (RA). The Muslims were ordered to boycott them for fifty days after which they were forgiven by divine decree and reintegrated within the community to the joy of the Muslims.",
       "Stage_summary": "In November 629, the Treaty of Hudaybiyah was broken by the Quraysh, leading to a series of events. The tribe of Bakr, supported by some Quraysh, attacked the tribe of Khuzaah, allies of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. Seeking help, Khuzaah approached the Prophet, prompting the Quraysh to send Abu Sufyan to negotiate. The Prophet rejected any new deal and began planning a campaign.\n\nOn the 10th of Ramadan, leading a large force, the Prophet ﷺ set out to conquer Makkah, keeping the mission secret. Concerned Quraish leaders sought peace and, under the cover of night, Abbas, Abu Sufyan, and Budayl came to the Muslim camp. Abu Sufyan and Budayl embraced Islam, but Abu Sufyan was held at the outskirts. The Prophet ﷺ prayed for victory and divided the army, instructing minimal bloodshed.\n\nThe Prophet ﷺ reached Makkah, entered peacefully, and engaged in prayer near the Kabah. He smashed idols, circumambulated the Kabah on his camel, destroyed divination arrows inside, and granted a general amnesty, except for ten individuals. After a speech at the Kabah, he withdrew to Mount Safa, inviting the people of Makkah to pledge allegiance, which they did one by one, flanked by Umar and Abu Bakr."

       "Combined_Content": "# The farewell Pilgrimage - 631 CE (10 AH):\nTowards the end of February 631 the Prophet announced his intention to make the pilgrimage journey known as Hajj. He set out with all his wives and a huge crowd of pilgrims, arriving outside of Makkah on the 3rd of March. He began to utter the ancient call of the pilgrims: 'Here I am at your service, O Allah.' Then he began to lead them through the old pagan rituals, so dear to the hearts of the Arabs, giving them a new significance. Instead of being reunited with their tribal deities, the Muslims were to gather round the \"\"house\"\"-the Ka'bah-built by  their ancestors Ibrahim (AS) and Ismael (AS).\nAs he entered the Holy Mosque he circumambulated the Ka'bah leading the pilgrims and walked between Safa and Marwah just as Haajar (RA), Ismael's (RA) mother, had done in search of help.\nOn the eighth day of Dhul Hijjah he left for Mina remaining there for a day. The next morning a while after the sun rose he continued to Arafah were he gave a grand sermon to the people informing them that he would not live to meet them on the Hajj again. He went on to explain some of the final commandments, that it is unlawful to shed blood (unjustly), to confiscate the wealth of one another, and that usury is forbidden. He incited the people to fear Allah concerning their women in that it is incumbent upon all believers to honour their conjugal rights. He went on to explain the most powerful means of reform for followers to come: the Book of Allah, the Qur'an, and his Prophetic Traditions; if his nation were to hold fast to the two, they would never go astray. In closing, he asked the masses whether he had delivered the message of Allah to which they responded positively. He then looked to the sky calling upon his Lord to bear witness to his proclamation of the message. After the speech, the pilgrims recalled their unity with the rest of humanity, when they made a standing vigil on the slopes of Mount 'Arafah, where, it was said, Allah had made a covenant with Adam, the father of the entire human race. Then at Mina, they threw stones at the three pillars as a reminder of the constant struggle (jihad) with satan. Finally, they sacrificed a sheep, in memory of the sheep Ibrahim (AS) sacrificed after he offered his own son to Allah.\n\n\n\n\n\n# The Choice - 632 CE (11 AH):\nWhen the Prophet returned from the Farewell Pilgrimage he began to experience incapacitating headaches and fatigue. He would often wrap a cloth around his aching temples and go to the Mosque to lead the prayers or to address the people. Moreover, despite being sixty three years of age, he still had the stature and grace of a much younger man, his eyes were still bright, and there were only a few white hairs in his black hair.\nOne morning after prayers he stood and addressed his followers and after praising those who died at Uhud he said \"\"Allah has given one of his servants the choice between this world and that which is with Allah, and he has chosen the latter.\"\" The only person who seems to have understood this reference to his imminent death was his closest friend Abu Bakr (RA), who began to weep bitterly. \"\"Gently, gently, Abu Bakr (RA),\"\" Muhammad ﷺ said tenderly.\nNaturally, the Prophet's companions became concerned and anxious. Soon he would resign himself to the quarters of Aisha (RA) where his wives would nurse him and tend to him. His fever increased in the first days of his sickness but whenever it would subside, the Prophet would walk to the Mosque to lead the prayers until one day, he was so overcome with fatigue that he ordered Abu Bakr (RA) to lead the prayers in his place.\nThe Prophet lay much of the time with his head resting on Aisha (RA)'s lap; but when Fatimah (RA) came Aisha (RA) would withdraw a little to allow the father and daughter some privacy together. Fatimah (RA), whom he loved deeply as his only surviving offspring, visited him every day. At one of these visits Aisha (RA) saw him whisper something to his daughter, who then began to weep. Then he confided to her another secret and she smiled through her tears. As she was leaving, Aisha (RA) asked her what he had said, and she answered that they were secrets.\nBut then later after the Prophet passed away, she informed Aisha (RA) about what the Prophet had whispered to her:\n** \"\"He first told me that he would meet his Lord after a short while and so I cried. Then he said to me: 'Don't cry for you will be the first of my household to join me.' So I laughed.\"\" **\nOn Monday the twelfth of Rabi' Al-Awwal, in the eleventh year of Islam, the Prophet's fever abated, and although he was exceedingly weak he decided to respond to the call to prayer and attend the congregation. The prayer had already begun when he entered, and the people were almost drawn away from it for joy at the sight of him, but he motioned them to continue. Abu Bakr (RA) realised the commotion could have only one cause and so stepped back to allow the Prophet to lead, but the Prophet placed his hand on his shoulder and pressed him to continue while he sat on his right and prayed seated.\nThe Prophet had now returned to his couch and was lying with his head in Aisha (RA)'s arms as if all strength had been used. None the less, when her brother entered the room with a tooth-stick in his hand, she saw the Prophet ﷺ looking at it in such a way that she knew he wanted it. So she took it from her brother and softened it and then gave it to the Prophet, who rubbed his teeth with it vigorously despite his weakness.\nNot long afterwards the Prophet lost consciousness as though it was the onset of death, but after an hour he opened his eyes. Aisha (RA) heard him murmur: \"\"With the supreme communion in Paradise, with those upon whom Allah has bestowed favours from among the Prophets and the truthful and the martyrs and the good, and a goodly company are they.\"\" And again she heard him murmur: \"\"O Allah, with supreme companionship\"\": and these were the last words she heard him speak. As his soul departed to its heavenly abode, his head grew heavier upon her chest, until the other wives began to weep, and Aisha (RA) laid his head on a pillow and joined then in weeping.",

Accompanied by his wives and a large group of pilgrims, he ﷺ reached Makkah in March. The Prophet ﷺ redefined traditional rituals, redirecting their significance toward the Kabah built by Ibrahim (AS) and Ismael (AS). Circumambulating the Kabah and walking between Safa and Marwah, he emulated Haajar's (RA) actions.\n\nOn the eighth day of Dhul Hijjah, the Prophet ﷺ moved to Mina, staying a day before proceeding to Arafah. There, he ﷺ delivered a profound sermon, addressing final commandments, emphasizing the sanctity of life, wealth, and prohibition of usury. He urged the people to honor conjugal rights and stressed the Quran and his Prophetic Traditions as guides for righteousness. The Prophet foretold his impending departure from the world.\n\nThe pilgrims, standing on Mount Arafah, symbolized unity with humanity, recalling Allah's covenant with Adam. At Mina, they symbolically stoned pillars, representing the struggle against Satan, and sacrificed a sheep, commemorating Ibrahim's (AS) sacrifice. The Prophet's ﷺ message was affirmed by the people, concluding with his plea to Allah for witness. This period marked a spiritual journey, blending sacred rituals with profound teachings."
